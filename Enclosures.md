# Enclosures

## Micro

You see these as mini-footswitches - tap-temp or favourite or additional momentary switches - and lots of pedal makers have their versions of these, mostly without LED - I have examples from Barn3, JHS and Strymon.

The enclosure is commonly designated as Hammond Manufacturing 1590LB : 51mm x 51mm x 31mm
The Strymon Favourite / Mini-Switch above is near enough per 1590LB dimensions.

## Mini

These are typically the smallest full-function pedals as typified by brands like Ibanez, Mooer, Pigtronix, TC Electronic and Tone City - and perfected by brands like Decibelics, Suhr, Wampler and Xotic. Pigtronix call their mini pedals 'Micro' which for me though is really the single mini-footswitch size before. When I think Mini, I think Mooer typically.

The enclosure is commonly designated as Hammond Manufacturing 1590A : 39mm x 93mm x 31mm
The Pigtronix Distortion Micro above measures : 38mm x 95mm x 31mm

> I picked the Pigtronix here as it exemplifies just how much can be accommodated functionality-wise at this level - with 4 control dials and a parallel/serial button switch.

## Compact

This is the most regular size of pedals, which I also occasionally call 'standard' size, and is best typified by both Boss's and MXR's enclosures in particular. The vast majority of modern pedals come in around this enclosure. Size-wise there are in fact two common designations which are the most prevalent.

>Note also that certain pedal-makers orient their pedals horizontally like Zvex does for its classic older style Fuzz Factory etc. while enclosure dimensions are usually around the same values.

- Enclosure type I: Hammond Manufacturing 1590B : 60mm x 112mm x 31mm
- Enclosure type II: Hammond Manufacturing 1590N1 : 66mm x 121mm x 40mm (also known as designation 125B by some)
- Above Chase Bliss Audio Warped Vinyl HiFi pedal measures : 66mm x 121mm x 40mm

## Medium Square

A number of pedal-makers use a roughly square enclosure to their own custom specifications as below - from smallest to largest, and including above pictured Source Audio Ventris Dual DSP Reverb:

- Strymon : 99mm x 112mm x 62mm
- Meris : 108mm x 108mm x 65mm
- Source Audio : 114mm x 114mm x 51mm
- Eventide H9 : 118mm x 133mm x 50mm

## Medium-Rectangle

The Medium-Rectangle enclosure can be seen in both horizontal and vertical formats. For numerous companies the Hammond 1590BB vertical is the most typical format - say Dwarfcraft and Spaceman Effects, while I also like it in its horizontal aspect, per Empress Effects most notably, as well as Keeley Engineering and MI Effects.

The key enclosure here is commonly designated as Hammond Manufacturing 1590BB : 119mm x 94mm x 34mm
The above Empress Effects Heavy has slightly custom measurements of : 114mm x 89mm x 34mm

## Large

Like the Medium-Square, the larger size pedals tend to be pretty custom dimensions and are anything beyond the most typical Medium-Rectangle dimensions, most typically seen in larger 3-footswitch button multi-effect workstations by the likes of Boss, Eventide and Strymon. The Empress Effects EchoSystem and Reverb kind of hover in the middle ground - where they can fall into either camp, depending on specific criteria. I will detail below the most common variations on this type from smallest to largest:

- Empress Effects : 145mm x 95mm x 44mm
- Boss : 170mm x 138mm x 62mm
- Strymon : 171mm x 130mm x 45mm
- Eventide : 190mm x 122mm x 54mm
