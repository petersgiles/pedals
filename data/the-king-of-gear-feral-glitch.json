    "details": "Limited Edition Stutter/Glitch Pedal with Adjustable RandomizationThe Feral Glitch is a stutter/glitch effects pedal with three modes and features three modes (2 glitch, 1 delay), optional random control, a high-pass filter for the effect, top-mount jacks, and true bypass.\nMost effects pedals distort, delay, pitch shift, or modulate a guitar's tone in an entirely predictable manner. The Feral Glitch's randomized stutter effect breaks this trend of predictability by introducing an element of chance. It takes a stutter effect - already rare in the pedal world - and randomly varies its length each time it is activated. This pedal offers not only this rare, musically random effect, but also a more conventional mode which can sync stutter effects to a particular tempo â€“ or even function as a quirky looper.\nhttp://thekingofgear.com/post/157526286991/a-totally-new-stutter-effects-pedal-for-radiohead",
