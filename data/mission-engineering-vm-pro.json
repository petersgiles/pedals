It also works with many other acoustic and electric instruments including electronic keyboards, steel guitars, and instrument microphones such as harmonica and horn mics.\nVM-PRO includes on board buffers, isolated tuner out, sparkle control, and compatibility switches for use with active and passive pickups and fuzz pedals.
