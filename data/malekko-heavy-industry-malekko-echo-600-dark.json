    "details": "600mS CCD Analog Delay BitchThe ECHO 600 was inspired by our love of bucket-brigade analog delays. The kind of delay that sweetens sounds and allows dirty feedback looping that dosenâ€™t quit. It features tons of headroom, switchable dual outputs, switchable true bypass or buffered output, expression pedal capability for regen control, a recessed LED indicator, a tough lexan face, and is hand made by us. The 3 controls provide complete control over the time, regeneration and mix of the dry/wet signal. In a stereo set-up, the 2nd wet output allows the delay regen to naturally fade out after you turn it off\nhttps://malekkoheavyindustry.com/product/echo-600d/",
