You get this awesome \"stacked\" drive type tones, along with wonderful noise distortion too. Its like a version of the other Dwarfcraft pedal \"The Internet\" but on steroids. Awesome pedal! \nFrom Dwarfcraft: TOTAL SPACK VIBES (Right Now) \nCreated special for Daniel Spack, SPECIAL! \nDan Spack, of course, is a member of Collections Of Colonies Of Bees, Volcano Choir and Group of the Altos, all INCREDIBLE Wisconsin based rock type groups. \nThis weaponized overdrive began as a tricked out version of our popular “The Internet” overdrive pedal.  In an effort to include ultimate control, we added the tone knob and a gain control for the foot switchable gain boost, labeled “harder.” \nBut HOLY MOLEY.  When it came together and hit the testing table, it’s true nature was revealed.  EVIL.  True, you can get familiar overdrive sounds, and a handy dandy boost, just like you would with The Internet.  But in addition to these, you can conjure up a plethora of scratchy harsh treble blasting noise distortion. \nDwarfcraft Designed, Dan Spack approved.",
