    "details": "Hall / Pitch / Modulated ReverbTreeverb is a compact, versatile reverb that offers deep but intuitive control allowing users to fit it into just about any setlist. Hall is a traditional, long reverb, with controls for Tone, Pre-delay (Character), and Length. Hall is the broadest mode in the Treeverb and can be tweaked to fit just about any standard reverb need. It can even simulate a slap back delay. Pitch mode starts with a reverb, of course, but the secret sauce is the dual pitch shifters that come next. One is an octave up, one is an octave down. If you’re looking for a HUGE sound, Dwarfcraft has a recipe you need to try. Modulated is made for all kinds of atmospheric, woozy, and sci-fi sounds. It is a big old reverb with a chorus on the wet signal. The Tone and Character knobs allow you to dial in chorus from an almost subliminal cycle to a deep vibrato.\nhttps://www.dwarfcraft.com/store/p126/treeverb.html#/",
