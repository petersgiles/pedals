    "details": "ReverberationMankind has long known of the amazing properties of reverberant spaces. From the brilliant refections of the largest concert halls to the splashy depths of your own shower, every space has its own characteristic sound.\nThe Space Race is our humble homage to the sounds of “elsewhere,” and features six ingenious ways to add some space to your place, whether you're reaching for the stars or just trying to make your world a little bigger.\nNeo Series:\nThe sonic scientists at Alexander Pedals have been working overtime to cram the most pedal into the smallest box, and we now present the Neo Series!  Each Neo Series pedal incorporates an advanced 32-bit microcontroller adding presets, expression, and MIDI capability.\nThe Neo Series pedals are small but mighty!  Imagine having a single pedal on your board that can access up to 4 separate preset tones with a touch of your toe.  Connect an expression pedal to \"morph\" between two distinct settings for each preset for dynamic real-time effects.  Or connect the Neo Footswitch to enable your choice of preset select, tap tempo, or an automatic ramp \"morph!\"\nPresets:\nAll Neo Series pedals feature a simple yet powerful preset functionality.  Hold the bypass footswitch to move the pedal to the next available preset, and the pedal will reconfigure itself on the fly.  All knob values and the effect mode settings are recalled, allowing you to set up to four unique tones.  Want more presets?  Simply connect a MIDI controller to the EXP port on the side of the Neo Series pedal and access up to 16 presets total.\nTo load a preset, hold the bypass footswitch down or send a MIDI program change from 0-15.\nTo save a preset, hold the Select button down and then hold the bypass footswitch.  The pedal will save the current settings to the current preset.\nAny changes you make to the pedal settings will be lost when switching to a new preset unless you save the current preset first, so be careful!\nExpression and MIDI:\nThe EXP port on the left side of the pedal can function as an expression pedal, foot switch input, or a MIDI input.\nExpression Pedal:  Set the expression pedal to the heel down position, then adjust the knobs to your preferred setting.  Sweep the pedal to the toe position and set the knobs to a different setting.  Now the Space Race will allow you to seamlessly morph between the two settings!\nFoot Switch:  The Neo Footswitch (sold separately) allows for preset select or ramp morph control - all with LED indication.  The Space Race will also work with a standard tap tempo footswitch.\nMIDI:  The Neo Series pedals can connect to a compatible MIDI controller to control all of the pedal functions plus access 12 extra presets, for a total of 16.  The USB port may also be used as a MIDI interface to your computer or mobile device.\nControls:\nControls in parentheses () are accessed by holding down the Select button and turning the indicated knob.\nReverb: Adjusts the size and decay of the reverb effect.\nSpace: Controls the pre-delay in most of the reverb modes. Check the description of each Effect Mode for details on how the Space control works in that mode.\nMix:  Controls the blend between the dry and delay signal.  Equal mix is at 1 o'clock.\n(Level):  Controls the overall output level of the pedal, from -20dB to +10dB.  Unity gain is near 1 o'clock.\nTweak: Controls a different parameter in each mode. Visit the Effect Modes section below for more details.\nSelect Button - tap to choose a new effect mode:\nMOD: Modulated chamber reverb. The Tweak knob controls the speed and depth of the pitch modulation.\nSHIM: Reverb with a pitch-shift component. The Tweak knob controls the pitch shift interval, either an octave down or an octave up.\nLOFI:  Dirty and filtered reverberation, like the echo you might get out of a broken karaoke machine.  Reverb and Space control the decay and pre-delay, respectively, while Tweak controls the amount of dirt and grit present in the reverb signal.\nPLATE: Bright and present reverb based on both a mechanical plate design and the early electronic plate reverb algorithms. Tweak adjusts the high-frequency damping of the reverb signal.\nSPRING: You know what this one is. Drippy and wet, this spring reverb simulation is great for both subtle and not-so-subtle effects. Reverb adjusts the size of the reverb tank, Space controls the “dwell” or input signal level, and Tweak controls the tone of the reverb signal.\nANALOG: Electronic reverb based on an obscure bucket-brigade echo circuit. This mode lacks all of the smoothing and diffusion of more modern reverb types, so you can hear each individual echo in the reverb tail. Reverb controls the delay time, Space controls the repeats of the echo, and Tweak adds an adjustable modulation effect.\nBypass Switching and AutoTrails:\nThe Space Race features a buffered bypass using a soft-touch footswitch.  The dry signal path is analog, to maintain your tone no matter how much reverb you add!  The bypass signal is 100% analog.\nThe Space Race features an innovative new feature - AutoTrails.  Some delay pedals cut the delay signal off as soon as you hit the footswitch - that sounds odd and unnatural.  Some leave the delay signal on all the time - that's better but you still get the noise from the delay signal even when you're not playing.  We give you the best of all worlds by letting you choose how long the delay trails persist, from instant-off to always-on.  When you bypass the Space Race, the reverb signal persists and then fades out smoothly after a time you set.  You want no trails?  Trails all the time?  No problem.  Set it any way that fits your playing style.\nConfiguration:\nTo configure, power on while holding the center Select button and release when the program LEDs start to flash.\nTap the Select button to choose Expression (upper LED blue,) Foot Switch (upper LED violet,) or MIDI (upper LED red.)\nTurn the Reverb knob to select the function for the Neo Footswitch - Counterclockwise for ramp, center for preset select.\nTurn the Space knob to set AutoTrails - counterclockwise for no trails, clockwise for longer trails settings.  Fully clockwise will leave the trails on at all times.\nTurn the Mix knob to select the Foot Switch Ramp speed - Lower LED blue slow, lower LED violet medium, lower LED red fast.\nTurn the Tweak knob to set the main LED brightness.\nIf you wish to assign the Space Race MIDI channel, simply send a program change message from your controller on the correct channel while the pedal is in configuration mode.  Hold the Select button to save the pedal settings.\nThe Space Race MIDI port requires the use of either a MIDI converter box such as the Neo Link, Disaster Area / Chase Bliss MIDIBox or a MIDI controller that supports 1/4\" devices such as the Disaster Area Gen3 series.  The Space Race defaults to using MIDI Channel 1.\nHOLD THE SELECT BUTTON TO SAVE CONFIGURATION\nPower Supply:\nThe Space Race requires a 9V DC power supply with a 2.1mm pin, center negative, 80mA.  The Space Race is not designed to be powered on supplies higher than 9V and does not use a battery.  The Space Race should work fine on a multi-pedal \"daisy chain\" connector, but if you encounter excessive noise or hum try a separate power supply.",
