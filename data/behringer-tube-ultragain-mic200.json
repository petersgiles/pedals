The MIC200 is ideally-suited for use with standard digital recorders and sound cards, imbuing signals with the warmth, presence and classic tube-compression that will bring your digital tracks to life.\nThe incredible MIC200’s controls consist of: switches for +48 V phantom power, 20 dB pad, Low Cut, and Phase Reverse; plus vintage-style Gain and Output knobs. An 8-segment LED meter provides accurate monitoring of output levels. And when used as a high-end DI (Direct Injection) box in the studio or on the stage, the MIC200 delivers flawless performance and outstanding signal integrity.\nhttps://www.behringer.com/behringer/product?modelCode=P0243",
