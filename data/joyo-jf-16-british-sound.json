    "details": "Marshall toneThe British Sound from JOYO gives you masses of versatility in one pedal. You can go from early 60's Marshall tone right up to the higher gain of the JCM800 & 900 series and everything in between.\nWith the gain knob and voice knob hovering around the 9 'o' clock point you can happily conjure Clapton-esque tones from your guitar, winding them both up to about 12 'o' clock will get you a 'Woodstock' sound reminiscent of a certain Mr Hendrix. As you go on from there you'll get more and more drive as you turn up the gain knob and voice knob to taste. Led Zeppelin, Gary Moore, Slash, Pete Townshend, Zakk Wylde, Yngwie Malmsteen & many more artists chose to use Marshall and you can replicate their tones thanks to the British sound.\nWith it's full 3 band EQ and voice knob you can easily dial in any tone you can think of. If your amp is a bit dark sounding then use the British Sound to brighten it up using the treble and voice knobs. If your amp is a bit brighter sounding then you can roll the treble off and increase the mids and bass a little.\nIf you need that Marshall In A Box type sound then the British Sound is the one for you. With miles of tone and a tiny price tag this pedal punches way above it's weight. A full metal housing combined with True Bypass switching and rugged construction only go to make this even more of a favourite. One of Joyo's most popular pedals with good reason.\nhttps://www.joyoaudio.co.uk/JOYO-JF-16-british-sound-effect-pedal",
