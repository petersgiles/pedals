    "details": "2-Channel 12AX7 Tube Preamp with OverdriveThe Legacy Drive is designed to feed nearly any power amp to drive guitar speaker cabinets with the Legacy sound. If you already have a favorite guitar amp and want to add a new sound, the Legacy Drive also works as a pedal into the front of your amp with a true hardwire bypass. Even if you are playing without an amp, Carvin’s third generation Cabinet Voicing circuit emulates the frequency response of a guitar speaker cabinet so you can send Legacy tones direct to headphones, effects, recording inputs or live PA without having to mic a speaker.\nSteve Vai began his journey with Carvin amplifiers very early in his career, with Frank Zappa’s recommendation to use the X-100B. In 1999, Carvin worked very closely with Vai to develop the Legacy series amplifiers which he has been using ever since. \nhttps://carvinaudio.com/products/vld1",
