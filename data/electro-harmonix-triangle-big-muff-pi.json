Dubbed the Triangle Big Muff because of the layout of its Volume, Sustain and Tone controls, this is the one that started it all. The new Triangle Big Muff is a faithful re-creation of the original circa 1969 circuit now housed in a pedalboard friendly, die-cast chassis.\nElectro-Harmonix founder, Mike Matthews, says: “The Big Muff Pi is the pedal we are best known for so I wanted to commemorate EHX’s 50th Anniversary (1968-2018) by re-releasing V1, the very first Big Muff. Original pedals are now selling for hundreds of dollars and this reissue absolutely nails that creamy, violin-like sustain and musical tone at a price a working musician can afford.”\nThe Triangle Big Muff features the following nods to convenience: an LED to indicate effect status, true bypass switching and the option of being powered by a 9-volt AC adapter.\nQuick Specs\n\nThe authentic V1 Triangle Big Muff reissued in a nano-sized chassis\nEffect status LED\nTrue bypass\nVintage look and graphics\n9V battery included, also accepts optional EHX 9.6VDC-200mA power supply\nCurrent Draw: 2.2mA @ 9VDC\nDimensions in inches: 2.75(w) x 4.5(l) x 2.1(h)\nDimensions in mm: 70(w) x 115(l) x 54(h)\n\nhttps://www.ehx.com/products/triangle-big-muff-pi",
