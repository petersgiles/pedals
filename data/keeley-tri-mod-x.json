After  not landing on a visual design for a new pedal I’m working on for 2019 I thought, I should just produce it with a stripped down prototype look.  That would be fun!  Then I started to think, heck what would it look like to have a few pedals with old “analog printed labels”?  What if I did x-number of pedals that way?  What About X Pedals?!\nI own a pedal company, I’ll just make my own ten X Pedals!\nWell then it got crazy.  Then I had to throw in some new stuff…a brilliant new reverb, a new rotary-vibe pedal, the world’s only flawless chorus pedal (yes it’s that good sounding), drives, fuzzes, echo, and of course compression!!\nThese were not designed for 2019’s big release party out in California at the NAMM show. Nope, this started out as a kind of self-indulgent, end of year endeavor.  But alas, I was taught to share, so here ya go.  I made 30 of each of the ten new X Pedals effects for you to put into duty\nhttps://robertkeeley.com/product/x-pedals-TriModX/",
