The tradition continued with the FV-50 series, but today the bar has been raised with BOSSâ€™s FV-500H (mono, high-impedance, inst. level) and FV-500L (stereo, low-impedance) pedals. These tank-tough diecast pedals are designed to meet the needs of the most demanding customers. The pedals offer a new stylish design, a road-tough build, and a comfortable, smooth action. Both models also provide an Expression output for use with expression-compatible amps, effects, and even synthesizers.\nhttps://www.boss.info/us/products/fv-500h_500l/",
