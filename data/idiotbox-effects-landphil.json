It is a modified and much more tweakable version of the Blower Box Bass Distortion. It has the same awesome HI/LOW-boost/cut, distortion and volume controls as the original but has an extra control for each giving a much wider range of bad ass bass distortion tones!\nhttps://www.idiotboxeffects.com/product/landphil",
