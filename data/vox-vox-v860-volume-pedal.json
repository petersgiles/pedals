The stylish aluminum body features a blasted and anodized finish that is both tough and classy. The pedal mechanism uses gears with a high tooth count, ensuring durability and smooth operation. The components are completely hand-wired, minimizing any change in the tonal character.\nhttp://www.voxamps.com/V860",
