    "details": "Chainsaw distortion\nNew for 2020 - we've updated the clipping footswitch to a relay based soft-touch to completely eliminate mechanical switches and improve the lifetime of the pedal. *\n\nHM2 but better. Now with a clean blend & Clickless bypass switch + top mounted jacks. \nControls include: Clean Blend, Low, Mid, High, Volume, & Distortion. 2nd footswitch engages diode clipping which adds not only a volume boost but also thickens up that normally thin chainsaw tone, this is great for leads & heavier parts in songs. \nhttps://www.abominablepedals.com/collections/pedals/products/throne-torcher",
