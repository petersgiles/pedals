    "details": "Loop switch with a built-in audio gateGating very complex sounds like fuzz and delay is always a challenge. The Loop Gate™ provides a loop switch with a built-in “perfect” audio gate (high headroom, no distortion, no hiss) that lets you set up a loop of pedals you can switch in and out of your signal path at will, but you have a couple of really fun options to control that loop that include a cross-fade “mix” option, as well as creating tremolo-like sounds with “chop” mode.\nhttps://www.zvex.com/products/loop-gate",
