    "details": "One-channel Signal Boost, Sending Direct BoxThe Mesa/Boogie Clearlink (Send) line driver is an effective way to send a strong guitar signal to your amp when it's placed far away. The Clearlink (Send) features a balanced XLR output that, when run in conjunction with Mesa's Clearlink (Receive), can deliver the perfect level signal up to 330 feet away, right to your amp's input. The 1/4\" unbalanced output works with the onboard output control to handle the same task over long cable runs direct to your amp. And Sweetwater players love how the Clearlink (Send)'s 9-volt DC thru feature will power the other Mesa buffer products on your board.",
