Its ultra-compact size fits even the smallest pedalboards – including Voodoo Lab Dingbat TINY and Pedaltrain Nano – and operates at any mains voltage for international touring. X4's innovative hybrid DC transformer design incorporates exotic components, linear regulation, and computer optimized filtering to establish industry-leading audiophile quality power that unveils the hidden sonic potential of your rig.\nAs well as delivering the cleanest, most reliable power for small pedalboards, Pedal Power X4 shines as a supplementary power supply in an expanding rig. Powering directly from any 12V 400mA output or X-Link port, X4 adds four isolated outputs to an existing Pedal Power. X4 can also power from the AC courtesy outlet of a Pedal Power 2 PLUS, significantly upgrading both its isolated output capacity and high current capability.\nhttp://www.voodoolab.com/pedalpower_x4.htm",
