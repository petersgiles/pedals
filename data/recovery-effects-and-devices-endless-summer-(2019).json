It features a boost allowing you to make things gritty, or go full-on over the top fuzzy and psychedelic. Simply put, it’s the coolest sounding and most unique reverb available!\nStart with the balance all the way to the left to get a splashy reverb with slight “buffered” boost. 9 o’clock grits it up and boosts your amp. Things get crazy at 12 o’clock! Dial in the color and depth with the brightness control. \nThe Endless Summer is hand-wired in Seattle, Washington. True bypass, lead-free solder, and yes, it has a real-spring-reverb tank inside! It operates on a standard Boss style 9vdc power supply (not included). Includes a limited lifetime warranty.\nEnclosure size: 5.625\" x 4.625\" x 1.563\"\nhttps://recoveryeffects.com/products/endless-summer",
