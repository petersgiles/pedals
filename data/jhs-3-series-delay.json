    "details": "Rich and warm or clear and pristine echoesThe JHS Pedals 3 Series Delay lets you choose between rich and warm or clear and pristine echoes. The straightforward design is simple and easy to use while offering a huge range of options. The Delay gives you 80ms to 800ms of delay time, for everything from slapback to long ambient washes of pad-like echo. The Type toggle allows you to select between a clearer digital-voiced delay and darker analog-voiced delay. The Delay will give you classic bucket brigade runaway when you max out the Repeats knob when in the analog-voiced delay mode. \nThe JHS Pedals 3 Series Delay runs on 9V DC Negative Center power and consumes 71mA.\nhttps://www.jhspedals.info/3-series-delay",
