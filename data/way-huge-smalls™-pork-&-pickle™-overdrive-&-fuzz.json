    "details": "Bass Fuzz / OverdriveNow in a Way Huge Smalls housing, the Pork & Pickle Bass Overdrive & Fuzz serves up a perfectly balanced diet of gnarly tones for bass players who like to get down and dirty. This delectable dish combines the warm, soft-clipping tones of the Pork Loin™ Overdrive and the rich, fatty tones of the Russian-Pickle™ Fuzz in a single pedalboard-friendly package.\nTo toggle between the two, just flip the OD/Fuzz switch. The Volume, Tone, and Drive controls perform their standard functions, applying to whichever dirt circuit is selected. This pedal has the Pork Loin Overdrive’s distinct sauced up clean channel from the Pork Loin Overdrive—a modified classic British style preamp—but it can be used with either mode. That means that, for the first time, you can run the Russian-Pickle Fuzz signal alongside that super sweet sounding clean channel. Stir in as much of the clean signal as you need with the Clean Blend control, and then use the Clean Tone control to season it to taste.If you’re the adventurous type, internal controls allow you to concoct more complex tonal recipes. The Pork Loin and Russian-Pickle circuits each have a level control, so you can set how much overdrive or fuzz is unleashed by external Volume control. Curve and Presence controls let you further refine the tone of the Pork Loin signal.\nhttps://www.jimdunlop.com/product/wm91-7-10137-11687-0.do?sortby=ourPicks&refType=&from=fn&ecList=&ecCategory=",
