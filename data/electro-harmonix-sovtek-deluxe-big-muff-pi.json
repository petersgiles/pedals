MIDS EQ – Parametric MIDS EQ section with a selectable center frequency ranging from 310Hz to 5.0kHz, a level control with up to 10dB of boost or cut and a high/low Q switch that sets the resonance/bandwidth of the EQ\n2. FOOTSWITCH for MIDS EQ – Dedicated on/off footswitch with status LED for the MIDS EQ circuit\n3. GATE – Noise gate to remove unwanted hiss and hum\n4. BLEND – Mix control for the dry and distorted signals. Enables bass players to retain their signal’s low end; also useful when layering in other distortion pedals\n5. WICKER– With the switch up, high frequency bandwidth is opened up for a more pronounced attack. Switch down yields the traditional Green Russian sound.\n6. EXPRESSION PEDAL INPUT – sweeps the frequency of the MIDS EQ to create wah wah and cocked wah effects\n7. TRUE BYPASS – maintains signal path integrity in bypass mode\nhttps://www.ehx.com/products/sovtek-deluxe-big-muff-pi",
