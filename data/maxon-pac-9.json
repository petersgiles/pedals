    "details": "Pure Analog ChorusThe first thing you’ll notice when you step on the PAC-9 is a beefy, full-bodied chorusing that punches you directly in the chest – gone are the thin, hissy, sissified chorus tones of yesteryear, replaced instead by a full-frequency effect that simply sounds massive.\nThe PAC-9’s circuit uses professional-grade IC’s typically reserved for High-End Audio applications, providing audiophile performance in a compact stompbox format.\nWhen compared to a standard chorus, the PAC-9’s effect appears more dramatic and has more presence in a mix – this is due to the retention of low and low-mid frequencies that are typically chopped out by other boxes.\nThe PAC-9’s LFO has an extended range that allows it to nail classic rotary speaker sounds with ease.  In addition to standard Speed and Width controls, The PAC-9 also features two unique controls:  The Pure switch boosts the delayed signal by 4 dB to create a more dramatic, tremolo-like chorus effect, while the Bright switch subtly scoops lows on the delayed signal for a more traditional chorusing sound.\nStandard and inverted (90 degrees out of phase) outputs allow for mono, stereo, or inverted mono signal routing options.\nThe PAC-9’s internal voltage-doubling circuitry provides maximum headroom to eliminate input distortion.  The higher operating voltage also allows it to be used in an FX loop to place the chorus effect post-gain.\nhttps://maxonfx.com/products/pure-analog-chorus-pac-9",
