    "details": "transparent overdrive with parametric HM-2 tonestack“Chaotic Evil Ned” takes the much-loved “Evil Ned” mini pedal and flips it on it’s head.  Where Evil Ned is a tiny, simple, overdrive with a 1-knob, HM-EQ blend, its giant alter-ego, Chaotic Evil Ned gives you ALL THE KNOBS!  Now you have control of gain & frequency of all 3 HM-2 EQ bands!  We encourage you to explore, but if you want to come back “home,” you’ll find the classic HM-2 sound when low, mid, and high are cranked and the frequency controls are somewhere in the 11-1 o’clock range.  If you’ve been looking for the ultimate heavy metal chainsaw, look no further.",
