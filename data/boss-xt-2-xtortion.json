    "details": "The XT-2 is a love or hate type of distortion pedal. It’s got a very hard edged distortion that sounds a bit different from other Boss distortion pedals. The tone controls are called Countour and Punch and is not just a renaming of bass and treble. Contour cuts highs or boosts highs and lows while Punch controls the distortion depth and adds a mid boost. Anyone tired of the convenional distortion sounds might like the XT-2.\nPedal production started July 1996 and was released together with the PW-2 soon afterwards. Production ended 11 months later with less than 20 000 pedals made.\nSpecifications\nControls: Level, Contour, Punch, Distortion\nConnectors: Input, Output, AC Adaptor\nCurrent Draw: 15 mA (DC 9V)\nRecommended AC Adaptor: PSA Series\nLabels\nSilver – Made In Taiwan\nThe XT-2 was sold from August 1996 to December 1998.\nhttp://www.bossarea.com/boss-xt-2-xtortion/",
