    "details": "Granular Sampler M O O D™ is a two channel granular micro-looper / delay. Designed to be playful and immediate, it is a study of interaction. M O O D™ is internally collaborative, allowing audio to freely pass back and forth between its two sides, evolving and transforming over time. Drolo FX is behind the loop channel, a collection of always-listening micro-loopers, and Old Blood Noise Endeavors offer us the wet channel, a suite of live spatial effects. We have three different options for how the channels are internally routed. Run a time-stretched loop through a cloud of delay taps, re-record it and carry on. Overdub, freeze, dissolve, smear. The device’s heart is the clock control, which slows or accelerates both sides simultaneously in harmonized steps. Instantly turn a loop into rolling chirps, or divide a reverb down into atmospheric noise. And naturally, we have full MIDI, dip-switch, and preset implementation.\nhttps://chaseblissaudio.com/product/mood/",
