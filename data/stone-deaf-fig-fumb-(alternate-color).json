    "details": "Paracentric Fuzz Filter PedalThe Fig Fumb adds class and control to the classic ‘Muff’ fuzz design. Bursting at the seams with the smooth singing fuzz-stortion tones that we all know and love, Fig Fumb sports a switchable noise gate, as well as a super precise Paracentric EQ for ultra-tight fuzz tones that’ll cut through any mix like a flaming sword through butter (that butter never stood a chance!). Plus, with on-the-fly tone sculpting or foot-controlled phaser and wah sounds via the optional Stone Deaf EP-1 active expression pedal, you suddenly have the coolest and most versatile fuzz pedal known to musickind.\nhttp://www.stonedeaffx.com/fig-fumb",
