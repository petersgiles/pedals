With billions of nanobots out of work, Dr. Scientist—with help from the National Research Council of Canada, the National Institute for Nanotechnology and the University of Alberta—developed a way to use nanotechnology to create a molecular junction, a new kind of diode that saturates in a slower, smoother, more pleasing way than conventional, silicon diodes. What resulted was a new kind of overdrive pedal, featuring three gain stages: a MOSFET booster, an NPN transistor fuzz and an opamp distortion.",
