Its trademark is an unparalleled purity and transparency of tone and harmonic richness making it a real texture machine. The subtle yet ever-changing way the controls interact has a truly mesmerising effect which speaks directly to the sub-conscious mind (as well as the stoned mind!). It covers the whole spectrum from mellow and virtually subliminal, to Hendrix-y, to crunchy and chomping (reminiscent of the ubiquitous 70's phase sound), to swirling rotary-type FX.\nhttp://www.lovetone.com/doppelg.html",
