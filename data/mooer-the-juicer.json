    "details": "OverdriveDesigned in collaboration with Neil Zaza, Mooer's The Juicer pedal takes after Zaza's favorite overdrive: the DOD FX51 Juice Box. Dynamic, sensitive, and full of impressive sustain capabilities, The Juicer is a sweet little pedal that gives just the amount of boost and crunch to your sound. It may be subtle, but that doesn't detract from its power: it can make all the difference in a rig that already has an OD or distortion, give you some more juice for an already-roaring amp, or perform just as well on its own.",
