    "details": "Expression/Volume PedalThe EV-1 is an expression pedal, perfect for use with all Fractal Audio Systems products and many 3rd party devices. Unlike most expression pedals it has a true linear response with planetary gearing and a long, smooth pedal throw. The EV-1 doubles as an analog volume pedal, with separate IN and OUT jacks connected to an audio-taper pot. It features a sturdy cast metal housing, comfortable non-slip rubber tread, and is available in either Silver or Black. It is larger than the EV-2.\nhttps://shop.fractalaudio.com/ev-1-expression-volume-pedal/",
