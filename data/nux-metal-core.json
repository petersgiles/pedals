Half Gain parameters offer modernized classic heavy metal sound which is best for the rhythm playing. The parameters will inspire you to break up your metronome and go for a faster-than-a-bullet solo!\nT-Lock Function\nWhen you set your tone up to ready-to-play, use the toggle switch and activate T-Lock to protect your parameters.\nBuilt-In Noise Gate\nMetal Core Deluxe has a dynamic Built-in Noise Gate, and you can dial up your tone with any Gain parameters you desire.
