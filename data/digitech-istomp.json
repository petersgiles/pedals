It can be completely reconfigured by loading it with any of the 47 e-pedals available in the Stomp Shop app.\nUnlike devices that require you to stay tethered to your iOS device, the iStomp does all of its processing internally. This means professional-quality, high-definition signal processing with no latency and you don’t need your iOS device while you’re playing.\nhttps://digitech.com/en/products/istomp",
