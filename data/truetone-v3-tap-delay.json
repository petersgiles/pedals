We heard from some players that they would love to have a scaled down, single tap version of the award-winning pedal. With that in mind, Truetone is proud to release the V3 Tap Delay!\nThe V3 Tap Delay is basically channel 2 of the Dual Tap Delay in a small, compact pedal. Perfect for cramped pedalboards, the V3 Tap Delay has all the features a player would want in a single delay pedal including Tap Tempo, Manual Mode, Tone Control, Time Divisions, Modulation, Dual Outputs, and of course control over Repeats and Effect Level.\nhttps://truetone.com/v3-tap-delay/",
