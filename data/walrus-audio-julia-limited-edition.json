    "details": "Chorus/VibratoWhile most chorus/vibrato pedals offer a toggle to go between the two effects, we’ve provided a knob to blend between Dry, Chorus, into Vibrato (labeled d-c-v on the pedal). The Dry-Chorus-Vibrato Blend changes the ratio of dry to wet signal sent to the output. At minimum, you will hear no effect. Set it to noon for equal parts dry and wet – the traditional chorus setting. Set it to maximum for 100% wet – the traditional vibrato setting. Explore the ground between minimum and noon for adding slight amounts of movement to your dry signal (also making the Julia great on bass guitar). Explore the ground between noon and maximum for all sorts of unheard chorus/vibrato combinations.\nThe Julia is a fully analog, feature-rich chorus/vibrato packed with a wide array of tonal landscapes begging to be explored. She is able to produce mild smooth chorus, to seasick vibrato and everywhere in between. With controls like Lag, Dry-Chorus-Vibrato Blend, and selectable analog LFO wave shapes, you are able to dial in all types of classic and unique chorus/vibrato sounds; some settings giving a familiar feel while others are not found on traditional chorus pedals.\nA special feature of the Julia is the Lag control. The Lag knob lets you set the center delay time that the LFO effect modulates from. From smooth and tight modulation at lower settings, to warbling detune at maximum, the Lag knob adds a new dimension to the traditional Chorus/Vibrato landscape. \nhttps://www.walrusaudio.com/blogs/news/limited-edition-julia",
