    "details": "Booster ComprssorWhen you want to fatten your guitar or bass tone, increase sustain and punch up your sound, a compressor is a way to go. But compressors can dredge up feelings of compromise, confusion, frustration and intimidation. So we set out to make a player-friendly pedal utilizing old school, all-analog, FET-based technology, which is inherently warmer, more transparent, and more musical than other methods.\nWith simplified, useful controls, the Boost COMP uniquely gives you pre- and post- tone shaping adjustability to get the right balance that complements your instrument and playing style. Presence provides a pre-compression tonal boost for high-end string attack and clarity. Tone provides a post-compression cut or boost to generate a mellower, more lush tone without getting too dark.\nWhen it’s time to jump out, a powerful boost function delivers up to 21dB of clean boost to increase your output level --without adding more compression. A true post-boost, this function can also be used independently.\nUncomplicated means less stress and more focus on your playing. Get vintage warmth, dynamics and sustain the easy way with the Boost COMP.\n9,53 x 12,1",
