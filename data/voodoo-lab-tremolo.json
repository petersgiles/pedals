    "details": "Tremolo with level controlThe Voodoo Lab Tremolo re-creates the buttery, seductive tone of a vintage tube amp tremolo. This is accomplished by using the same lamp and photocell assembly found in many popular vintage amps.\nThis pedal also features a slope control which lets you adjust the feel from a traditional soothing tremolo to a hard “machine-gun” stutter. Speed and intensity controls provide a wide range to include very slow and deep sounds. A volume control lets you cut or boost the output level. Now you can add warm, mind-bending trem vibes to any amp with the most versatile tremolo available\nhttp://www.voodoolab.com/tremolo.htm",
