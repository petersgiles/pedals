    "details": "JUPITER-8 synthThe legendary JUPITER-8 synth is back as a limited-edition module no bigger than a book. Part of the Roland Boutique series, the JP-08 is all about hands-on control and that iconic JUPITER sound. With an array of 36 knobs and sliders from the original JUPITER-8 front panel, the 4-voice JP-08 is highly programmable and encourages sonic experimentation, especially with the built-in speaker and battery operation. Using Roland’s acclaimed Analog Circuit Behaviour (ACB) technology the JP-08 faithfully reproduces the original JUPITER-8 sounds and adds a few new twists in the form of extra LFOs and expanded VCO range. \nhttps://www.roland.com/global/products/jp-08/",
