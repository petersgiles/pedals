    "details": "Made in collaboration with Toska/Dorje guitarist and Andertons TV presenter Rabea Massaad, the Tone City Wild Fro is an aggressive-sounding distortion pedal with dangerous levels of gain on tap! Based on Tone City's popular Wild Fire stompbox, the Wild Fro has been slightly modified to meet Massaad's specific tonal demands.\nMonstrous Distortion\nTone City produces a number of dirt pedals, but the majority of them are designed to offer traditional low-to-medium gain overdrive sounds. The Wild Fro, however, definitely breaks the mould!\nBuilt to deliver sizzling modern distortion, The Tone City Wild Fro remains tight and focused even with its 'Gain' control cranked, making it apt for technical and percussive Massaad-style riffs. Want to add even more definition? Simply turn up the 'Tone' control and you'll cut through effortlessly in even the most frantic of metal mixes.\nIt doesn't end there though! The Wild Fro also boasts a 'More' switch which provides an extra dose of glorious gain. Perfect for laying down lead guitar parts with, this thoughtful addition adds even more flexibility to an already versatile mini stompbox. What more could you possibly want?\nSmall & Portable\nAlmost all Tone City pedals are built in mini enclosures, which helps to save precious real-estate on your pedalboard. But don't worry, you don't lose any sound quality with micro-sized stompboxes! Tone City uses high-quality components to construct its pedals, and with true bypass switching, your signal will remain as clean and pure as possible when the pedal is disengaged.",
