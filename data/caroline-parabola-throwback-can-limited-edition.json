    "details": "Solid State TremoloThe Parabola is a solid state, transistor generated waveform tremolo. The oscillator is strongly influenced by the vintage Schaller TR-68/TR-316 “West Germany” tremolo pedals that I fell in love with in the 1990s. They have a gorgeous analog waveform that actually changes shape with the depth control.\nhttps://carolineguitar.com/product/tremelo/",
