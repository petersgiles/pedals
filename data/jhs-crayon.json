    "details": "British Style Preamp DriveThe JHS Pedals Colour Box is amazing. It’s powerful, it’s versatile, it sounds stunning as a guitar pedal or as a recording preamp, and sometimes...just sometimes...it’s a bit too much for guitarists. That’s why we created the Crayon. This straightforward pedal harnesses the exact same gritty preamp tones of the Colour Box and puts them in a smaller stomp with a simplified control layout. Three knobs control the gain, output, and tone of the pedal, while a Hi-Pass switch accesses even more aggressive characters. If you’re one of the musicians who is madly in love with those straight-to-console fuzz tones but don’t need all the extras, the JHS Pedals Crayon was made just for you.\nhttps://www.jhspedals.com/products/bass-pedals/thecrayon/",
