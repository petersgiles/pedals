    "details": "Synesthesia is an advanced, yet user friendly dual-channel multi-modulation engines, capable of running two modulation algorithms simultaneously. Packed with 22 classic and modern algorithms (expandable to 30 with future updates) and 3 different DSP routing schemes Synesthesia offers limitless sonic possibilities.\nSynesthesia is not just another modulation pedal. By marrying a powerful dual-engine architecture with rich and deep algorithms we provide players with immersive and 'colorful' modulation effects experience, hence the name : Synesthesia.",
