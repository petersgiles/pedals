    "details": "Mini PhaserIbanez is proud to announce a new addition to the MINI pedal lineup. The Phaser MINI is made in Japan and features three controls; DEPTH, FEEDBACK and SPEED. Through these controls, the Phaser MINI offers a variety of sounds ranging from subtle texture to deep saturation. Moreover, it is designed to retain a clarity of dry signal even when set to the highest effect intensity. It also features switchable STAGE mode, 4 or 6. 4-STAGE mode delivers traditional Phaser tones, typically used in classic rock. 6-STAGE mode provides more intense and dramatic effect. The PHMINI also features 100% pure analog circuitry and a true bypass switch. The PHMINI delivers a multitude of analog Phaser features, while occupying minimal space on your pedalboard!　\nhttps://www.ibanez.com/eu/products/detail/phmini_01.html",
