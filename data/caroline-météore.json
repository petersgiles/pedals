    "details": "Lo-Fi Reverb – Limited Edition PurpleNamed for the ultra-modern line 14 of the Paris Metro and its spacious interiors of glass, tile, and steel that add all kinds of nasty sonic textures at its stops, the Météore is a reverb both for straightforward users and for players who wish to be inspired and challenged by this effect. Built on a frame similar to our acclaimed Kilobyte® Lo-Fi Delay, Météore uses a digital spring reverb “brick” to provide you with traditional sounds, or empower you to distort, magnify, and extend the effect into oscillation. For this pedal, the Havoc™ control allows for infinite hold or ramped escalation into entropy and collapse based on how you set the size control.",
