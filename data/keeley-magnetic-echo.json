With delay ranging from 40ms to 600ms, you can dial in everything from short slapbacks to dub-style echoes. Set the delay time, delay regeneration, and delay level to get the right delay effect, then use the wow and flutter controls to fine-tune the magnetic tape effect. We've played countless delay pedals at Sweetwater, and we know you'll dig the analog vibe of the Keeley Magnetic Echo tape-style digital delay pedal.\nhttps://robertkeeley.com/product/magnetic-echo/",
