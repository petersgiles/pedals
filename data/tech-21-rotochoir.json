    "details": "Leslie SimThe Roto Choir celebrates the swirling glory of a vintage rotating speaker cabinet.With its\nspecifically formulated SansAmp™ technology, the Roto Choir takes this concept to the next\nlevel. It delivers the entire signal chain--from the original tube power amp to the low-frequency\nspeaker and high-frequency horn to the microphone used to capture it.This studio-quiet,roadworthy pedal can be used with guitar as well as keyboards,synths and vocals --and to record direct.\nThe Roto Choir offers an abundance of easy-to-use, intuitive controls in an incredibly compact,\nbattery operable pedal. It features a Fast/Slow foot-switch which allows you to ramp up,slow\ndown, or even stop the rotating speaker.There’s a dedicated Top Speed control to custom set\nthe rotor speed and a Position control to adjust the virtual mic closer to or further from the\nhorns. A Biamped switch allows you to change from single speaker mode to Biamped mode,\nand there’s a Speaker Sim switch for direct recording.\nThe Drive, High, Low and Level controls are 100% analog for warm, organic sounds. Stereo output, buffered bypass, and a silent-switching, custom foot- switch actuator completes the package.\nYou can get lost for days exploring and discovering all the celestial sounds lurking within the\nRoto Choir.\nhttp://www.tech21nyc.com/t21manuals/ROTO-OM.pdf",
