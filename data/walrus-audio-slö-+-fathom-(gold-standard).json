    "details": "Two ReverbsThis exclusive Walrus Audio Gold Standard pedal features the Fathom Multi-Function Reverb with Hall, Plate, Lo-Fi and Sonar (Octave) settings, modulation, momentary bypass and momentary sustain. \nThe left side of the pedal contains the Slö Multi-Texture Reverb with 3 ambient, soundscaping modes: Dark (Lower Octave), Rise (Volume Swell) and Dream (huge ambient verb with latching feature). The Slö can also modulate its trails with three different wave shapes that can be adjusted with the X knob. \nThese two effects can be run in series or go further and use the out of the Fathom to go into any other pedal and back into the Slö. Create textures worth their weight in gold by using the latching feature on the Slö to create a sparkly pad to fit underneath your floating trails from the Fathom. Take your sound to space.  Take your sound deep underwater. Take your sound to Timbuktu. This will help you get there.\nLimited to 196 units.\nhttps://reverb.com/item/33820707-walrus-audio-fathom-slo-walrus-audio-exclusive-gold-standard-series-one",
