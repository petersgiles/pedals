    "details": "Delay/ReverbIt’s the result of years of research & development, our community’s great input and Misha’s extensive delay collection ranging from vintage tape echoes to modern crisp delays.\nMono and Stereo I/O's: The Flux Echo is designed to work great with most setups including traditional mono rigs as well as stereo rigs with multiple amps/instruments, it even sounds great with synthesizers.\nFlux Mode: Variable switch that allows 3 distinct voices: a warm, ambient reverb with clean analog delay repeats, a lightly modulated reverb with a smooth reverse delay, and a shimmer reverb with a tape-style echo.\nTap/Hold switch: Tap to set your delay tempo, hold to freeze both reverb and delay. Once you let go both will decay as set.\nBypass/Delay and Reverb Trails switch: Tap to turn the Flux Echo on or oﬀ.  Hold the bypass switch down while the pedal is on to enable or disable delay/reverb trails.\nhttps://horizondevices.com/products/flux-echo",
