    "details": "Dual Channel Brown SoundFIREMAN is based on the legendary amplifier builder's famous distortion pedal. It's a very amp-like distortion pedal with Modern Brown Sound. We designed it with 2 independent VOLUME, GAIN control knobs to fit rhythm and solo applications. FIREMAN offers a True-bypass / Buffer-bypass toggle switch,  and a 9V / 18V toggle switch. The 18V position doubles the working voltage inside to give you wider dynamic range.\nhttps://www.nuxefx.com/fireman.html",
