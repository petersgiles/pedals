    "details": "Amp Simulator of the Vox AC-30The Joyo AC Tone JF-13 pedal reproduces the sound of a Vox AC30 amplifier--that classic British rock sound all guitarists dream about. It has sparkly high end, like the Top Boost model, and works on Drive to about 7 for subtle forms of overdrive with harmonic overtones. Good for players who value a clean sound with a little warmth. It can also dirty up when drive is cranked hard to 9 or 10. Sounds really good direct.\nVox Style British Class A Amp Sim\nLevel, Voice, Drive controls\nVoice control shapes overdrive character\nSturdy aluminum alloy case\nUses 9V battery or standard Boss style adapter\nhttp://www.joyoaudio.com/en/product/show_111.html",
