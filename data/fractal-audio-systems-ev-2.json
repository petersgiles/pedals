    "details": "Expression/Volume PedalThe EV-2 is a compact expression pedal, perfect for use with all Fractal Audio Systems products and many 3rd party devices. Unlike most expression pedals it has a true linear response with planetary gearing and a long, smooth pedal throw. The EV-2 doubles as an analog volume pedal, with separate IN and OUT jacks connected to an audio-taper pot. It features a sturdy cast metal housing, comfortable non-slip rubber tread. It is available only in black. In comparison to the EV-1, the EV-2 is smaller and lighter. \nhttps://shop.fractalaudio.com/ev-2-expression-volume-pedal/",
