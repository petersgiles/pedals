    "details": "TremoloAt the heart of the new Diamond Tremolo is a 100% analog signal path utilizing an optoisolator like vintage tube amplifiers of the 60’s. The analog signal path is combined with a microprocessor controller to provide a host of cool features including:\n– tap tempo and footswitchable double speed mode\n– user selectable waveforms (sharkfin, sinewave, square wave and ‘chop’)\n– timing accents (3/4, 6/8, 2/4 and 4/4)\n– rhythmic trem mode\n– ‘Chaotic’ mode – random speeds with any waveform!\n– TapView (TM) feature allows the player to visually see the tempo and tap speed while tapping a new setting.\nIt’s important to note that at no point is your instrument signal converted to digital! Everything you hear is completely analog. Vintage sounds, modern flexibility\nhttp://www.diamondpedals.com/products/tremolo/",
