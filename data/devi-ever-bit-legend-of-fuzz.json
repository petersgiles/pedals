    "details": "Unmerciful bastard of a fuzzThe Bit : Legend of Fuzz has been compared to the Shin-ei Companion FY-2 fuzz, but with a stronger gate on circuit settings. Some say, it’s a sound that haunts you at night… the desperate 8 bit beep that reminds you your heart is empty and you are close to death. Nostalgia is a lie. It tells you some how something that was is better than what is or what could be. Here it is though. A fuzz that elicits the sound of old video games… I guess. I mean, a lot of my gated fuzzes can do that for you. This one likes to particularly twist your guitar signal in a way that’s relatively like a saw tooth… a pretty fucked up saw tooth. Maybe we’ll define a new kind of saw tooth wave shape now… shark tooth, because that’s what this fuzz sounds like… a shark’s mouth full of teeth ready to clench down, and it doesn’t matter if a few are lost while eating cold rusted steel from a 1950′s buick rotting on the bottom of the ocean, because there is more where that came from. Unmerciful bastard of a fuzz really… just like that beep beep beep counting down the moments till your inevitable death\nhttps://deviever.net/products/devi-ever-fx-bit-legend-of-fuzz",
