    "details": "The RV-2 was the first digital reverb pedal on the market. Digital reverbs had prior to the RV-2 only been available in rack mounted units. The RV-2 changed all that when it was launched 1987. The RV-2 have the highest current draw of any Boss compact pedal. As a result of this it was originally sold with a PSA Power adapter. The pedal and the power supply wouldn’t fit in a normal compact pedal box so the RV-2 was sold in a larger box similar to the one used for the PSM-5.\nThe RV-2 has 6 different modes: Room (8 meters depth), Hall 1 (15 meters depth), Hall 2 (30 meters depth), Plate, Gate and Panning Delay. The reverb time is adjustable from 0.2 to 10 seconds. In front of the reverb circuit there’s a pre-equalizer circuit. The production span of the RV-2 was likely very short and might have ended as early as mid 1988.\nSpecifications\nControls: E.
