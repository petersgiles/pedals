The CRYSTAL DAGGER is a dual harmonic device comprised of independent circuits; a scorching octave-up fuzz and a unique conglomeration of ring modulation, unpredictable octaving, and phasing. The circuits are both true-bypass footswitchable and run in series, from input to (OCT)FUZZ circuit to (MOD)RING circuit to output.
