It distorts, glitches, and clips, and does things to your instrument that naturally should not happen. From super thick fuzz, to starved splatty sounds, the Sound Destruction Device sounds like a Marshall stack on its deathbed.\nThe Sound Destruction Device is point-to-point hand wired, with no printed circuit board. Chrome plated LED. Lead-free solder, and U.S.A. parts whenever possible. It operates on a standard Boss style 9vdc power supply (not included), or 9 volt battery. It includes a full-lifetime warranty.\nhttp://www.graigmarkelmusic.com/Graig_Markel_Music/Sound_Destruction_Device.html",
