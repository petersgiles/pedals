    "details": "Dual filter and distortionThe Jekyll n Hyde is a dual LP filter distortion box with enhanced resonant feedback. One Transistor ladder filter and one Diode ladder filter. The input can be linked to feed a mono signal into each filter creating a wide stereo effect. This sounds great with mono analog synths. Both filters have a pre drive/distortion, a post gain and germanium clipping. Each filter also has a slow drifting LFO for subtle modulation and CV ins for filter control.\nJnHwesiteCardThe filters can also be used separately for stereo processing.  Just unlink the inputs with the M/S toggle in the back. Depending on how you have it dialed in the you can create a very wide stereo field or a more natural one. Both filters have a different method of distortion in the pre-drive section. Jekyll is cleaner, Hyde can be made to be fully distorted.",
