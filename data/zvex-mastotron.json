    "details": "FuzzA sub-heavy silicon fuzz with some new twists: An input impedance control (push/relax) that adjusts from passive pickupsto line level. It works very well for re-amping bass tracks that needto be fuzzed up after tracking and keyboards. There’s also a three-position sub control switch, a treble tone control, adjustable pulse width, and a wide fuzz depth control. More flexible than any silicon fuzz to date.\nhttps://www.zvex.com/products/mastotron",
