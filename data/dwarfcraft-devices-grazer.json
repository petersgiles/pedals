    "details": "Granular pedalDid you ever wonder what it would sound like if a machine took micro-samples (or “grains”) of your input and repeated some of them as you played? Oh, the machine also sometimes just loops some grains! Wow, I thought I was the only one!\n​Wait, did you also hope to define the sample length via knob or expression pedal? Shift the grains pitches up so high they become a supersonic computer weapon?\nThis is getting weird… if you also wished to toggle between forward and reverse playback, and have a foot switch to repeat the grains at any time, for as long as you hold the switch… then we are in some serious sci-fi stuff right now. Yikes.\nAnyway, that’s what the Grazer does\nhttps://www.dwarfcraft.com/store/p109/Grazer.html#/",
