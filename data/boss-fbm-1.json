Thanks to BOSS' technology and tone know-how, the new FBM-1 pedal brings the natural, fat, rich, bright tone of the Fender Bassman to a BOSS pedal. In conjunction with Fender, the BOSS FBM-1 re-creates the legendary tone of the 1959 Fender Bassman. Features include the same controls on the original Bassman amp: Presence, Treble, Mid, and Bass EQ controls. The FBM-1 pedal also functions perfectly as a \"pre-gain pedal\" placed before an already overdriven amp to add the tone character of the Bassman.\nFeatures:\n* Re-creates the legendary tone of the 1959 Fender Bassman amp\n* Additional BRIGHT IN provides a brighter sound, similar to the original Bassman\n* Presence, Treble, Mid, and Bass EQ controls\n* Road-tough BOSS metal construction\nhttps://www.boss.info/us/products/fbm-1/",
