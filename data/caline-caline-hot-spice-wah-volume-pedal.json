    "details": "Tones based on the Jim Dunlop style wah sound as well as a switch to swap to a volume pedal. This is a nice sounding small footprint pedal that really does capture the vibe of the wah pedal sound very well. The build quality is really good too.\nThe new Hot Spice delivers both an excellent Wah response along with Volume function and all in a smaller footprint much shorter than a standard Wah or Volume. Switch on the side for either Wah or Volume. Can sit comfortably on most pedal boards and very useful in either clean or gain settings. Features of  the HOT SPICE Wah Pedal:\nWah Wah mode and Volume mode 2-in-1. 2.\nThe tune of Wah is based on the original Crybaby response.\n Active volume mode will keep lossless tone.\nTrue bypass design.\nSmall size, will fit most pedalboard configurations. Dims as follows: (looking down at unit) 5/14\" H x 2 1/4\" W x 2\" D\nPowers on 9V Dc center or TIP Negative (same as BOSS wall power) not included.\n\nhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/Caline-Effect-Pedal-CP-31-Wah-Pedal-Hot-Spice-Switchable-Volume-Pedal-Footswitch-Wah-Wah-2/32820976927.html",
