It distorts, filters, oscillates, glitches, clips, and does things to your instrument that naturally should not happen. From super thick fuzz, to starved splatty sounds, to wild oscillation that can be controlled with an expression pedal, the Sound Destruction Device sounds like nothing you’ve ever heard. \nhttp://www.graigmarkelmusic.com/Graig_Markel_Music/Sound_Destruction_Device.html",
