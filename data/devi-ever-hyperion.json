Imagine, if you will, a Big Muff with enough steroids in its system to kill an ox with its proverbial little finger. The new Hyperion 2 also adds oscillation to this heavy-hitter’s already impressive resumé, opening Pandora’s Box for all sorts of sonic mayhem, mischief and whimsy. The Hyperion 2 also shares its name with a legendary British thoroughbred stallion. It’s no coincidence that it’s just as well-equipped in the trouser department. Isn’t it about time that your pedalboard got hung like a horse?",
