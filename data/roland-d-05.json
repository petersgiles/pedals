This revolutionary instrument helped define the sound of the late ‘80s with its instantly recognizable mix of sampled attacks and synthesized sustaining waveforms, plus built-in chorus, reverb, and EQ. It’s the basis of classic tracks in a wide range of genres including synth pop, new wave, new jack, and R&B, and can be heard in countless film scores of the era. With the Roland D-05, you get the iconic sound and dedicated control of the D-50 in a modern device that perfectly recreates the legendary synth down to its finest details.\nhttps://www.roland.com/global/products/d-05/",
