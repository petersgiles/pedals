    "details": "AUTHENTIC TUBE TONEMany pedals try to emulate the sound of tube breakup; we decided instead of emulating tube distortion, we’d use actual vacuum tubes and give you the real deal in a compact pedal. The heart of the MTG’s design is a NOS (New Old Stock) US-made 6205 preamp tube. 3-Band EQ with Tight control and switchable boost—with its own Level and Boost controls—makes it easy to dial-in just the right sound.\nFeatures\n    - Real tube-driven distortion pedal\n    - NOS 6205 preamp tube\n    - 3-Band EQ; Boost with Gain and Level controls\n    - LED-backlit knobs; Fender Amp Jewel LED\n    - Standard 9VDC center-negative power connection\nhttps://shop.fender.com/en-US/effects-pedals/mtg-tube-distortion-pedal/0234539000.html",
