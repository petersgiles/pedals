We have re-designed the original and added new features to take this British stack-in-a-box to the next level!\nFor starters, the new Super Crunch Box features all the gain you could ever need. The 3 COMP settings give you 3 levels of clipping, from open classic crunch, sizzling ‘traditional’ Crunch Box to hot-rodded ‘Jose’ clipping. Paired with the new 3 position MODE switch opens up a world of tonal bliss, from the original high gain tones, the more detailed mid gain, and the brand new low gain mode, which is tailored for detailed single-coil duty, with a lightning fast, top end, and a remarkable touch sensitivity.\nhttp://miaudio.com/effects/super-crunch-box-distortion-v-2/",
