    "details": "Resonant EchoThe LastGasp Art Laboratories Misty Cave is an effects pedal that creates an analog resonance echo and reverb. It creates a resonant space that is inherently sensitive to the pitch of the input signal. This sound is reminiscent of delay-style feedback oscillation with a natural decay, which maintains the integrity of the input signal even when used with multiple delay pedals. A dedicated D. Time control affords manual control over which note oscillates.\nAdditionally, Misty Cave features a CV jack allowing for the D. Time parameter to be controlled via expression pedal.",
