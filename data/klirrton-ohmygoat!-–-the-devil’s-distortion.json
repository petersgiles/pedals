    "details": "The devil’s distortion“This is the most satanic distortion pedal you have ever heard!”, Kristian Kohle a.k.a the Goatloard says!\nThe story behind OhMyGoat! is really simple. The unholy Goat appeared at Klirrton’s workshop with a mean looking entourage of famous metalheads (Mika of Grave, Guilherme of EntombedAD and many more…) and forced us to redesign the Bottomshaker channel of the mighty Grindstein to become a standalone, badass distortion.\nKohle and I refused to do so, but they treated us with country, R’n’B and Opera-Metal and forced us to drink warm alcohol-free beer!\nSo we tweaked it, bathed it in blood, did a redesign and played unholy riffs until they screamed:\n“Oh My Goat!, that’s it! The tone straight out of Hell!”.\nAnd here it is! The devil’s distortion.\nFEATURES:\nMore distortion you will ever need with different flavors (Boost control and Gain control)\nHighly effective EQ (huge lowend, higly tweakable highs)\nA very complex sounding mid control that can go from tranistor-like, scooped mids to beautiful sounding, warm mids\nCan be played into a clean channel or into a poweramp (or even straight into IRs)\nInternal noisegate with 3 intensity modes (Off/Moderate/Aggressive)\nhttps://klirrton.com/product/oh-my-goat-the-devils-distortion/",
