    "details": "OverdriveWhile the JDS-50’s sleek and un-assuming looks may insinuate that you’ve got a standard overdrive pedal before you, the JDS-50 really isn’t quite like any other overdrive out there.\nFrom its perfectly balanced frequency spread, to the ridiculous dynamic response held within, the JDS-50 is not only an indispensable pedal-board staple, but a highly expressive instrument unto itself.\nEffortlessly delivering tones ranging from meticulously tuned, touch-responsive crunch, to thick harmonic-laden overdrive and even to near-full distortion, the JDS-50 not only sounds phenomenal, but responds and feels like a high-quality tube amplifier, all while retaining the unique signature tonal characteristics of your guitar, or bass.\nhttps://www.mrblackpedals.com/collections/pedals/products/jds-50",
