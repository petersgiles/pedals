    "details": "Analog MN3008-based Chorus PedalThe CHORAL REEF analog chorus pedal took 2 years and many failed attempts to perfect. The result was a no-compromise design built upon the MN3008 bucket brigade chip to satisfy VFE’s high standards for noise, headroom, and versatility. A whole host of chorus tones are available, including flanger and vibrato. The unique feedback circuitry lets you add a touch of resonance or dive into deep modulated chaos that rings on after you stop playing.\nhttp://www.vfepedals.com/sps.html",
