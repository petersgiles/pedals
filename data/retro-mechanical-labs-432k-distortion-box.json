    "details": "432K Distortion Box (standard meter)The 432k Distortion box is all about signal routing. One distortion circuit with an active hybrid diode/transistor ladder filter (with resonant feedback) for tone control. Another with a clean pass signal. Both signals are merged together and “glued” through a transistor drive and op amp style fuzz. A feedback noise circuit is added in for fun. Also equipped with CV in for filter control. Use a CV pedal to control the filter.\nDistortion: Volume of Distortion\nFilter: Filter Frequency\nResonance: Active resonant feedback\nClean: Clean signal\nLow Cut: low end roll off\nTransistor: Transistor gain/drive\nOp Amp: Op Amp Fuzz\nFeedback: Noise loop (works best with sequenced sounds)\nOutput: Volume\nPrice: $349 (non vintage meter)\nWith Vintage Meter: $399\nWith Vintage Meter and Removable lid: $449\nhttp://www.rmlfx.com/?p=830",
