    "details": "DistortionRiot Reloaded is the result of countless hours of listening, testing, and\ntweaking our original distortion circuit to create a pedal that is amp-like,\naggressive, in your face, and features more gain (30% more than our original\nRiot), ideal for players seeking Hi-Gain Rock, Metal, and drop tuning style\ntones. Riot Reloaded features an easy to tweak layout which includes\nDistortion, Level, Tone, and a three position Voice switch.\nCONTROLS\nDist: Adjusts the amount of distortion added to your tone, taking you from a\nclassic crunch to blistering high gain.\nLevel: Adjusts the Riot Reloaded’s overall output. Use this control to\nminimize the difference between the affected and unaffected signals.\nTone:  Shapes the overall tonal response of the pedal - from smooth and\nwarm to cutting lead tones. Riot Reloaded’s tone control was modified to\nemphasize upper mid-frequencies for a sweeter, more cutting tone, without\nsounding harsh or fatiguing.\nVoice Switch (three position):\nRedesigned to be more apparent offering flexibility, giving you the ability to\nfine tune your sound.\nLeft: Produces a natural, organic tone that responds dynamically to your\ninstrument’s volume control.\nMiddle: Puts you into high gain territory with a solid midrange, and a fat\nbottom end.  \nRight: Produces a classic mid-scooped response, with excellent definition.\nNote: The Voice switch may have less effect at lower gain and tone settings.",
