Whether you’re covering Cream or Muse, or creating your own sounds, this pedal should help get you there.\nFeatures:\n-Level (volume)\n-Scream (gain)\n-Fuzz\n-3-way clipping toggle (left: silicon, center: asymmetrical LED, right: Schottky)\nPower:\n-Standard center negative 9V DC supply, or 9V battery (neither included)\n-Current draw: ~7mA\nDimensions:\n-4.42\" L x 2.39\" W x 1.24\" H\nhttps://cusackmusic.com/collections/all-products/products/screamer-fuzz-bass",
