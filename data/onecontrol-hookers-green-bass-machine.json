    "details": "OverdriveHooker's Green Bass Machine (HGB) is an all-purpose bass machine for any genre after the 1950s. The impression I get when I increase DRIVE to full is like the bass sound that Lemmy from Motorhead makes. I tested it with a guitar, both with transistor and tube amps. It worked well with any guitar amps and pickups. It could be a great trick to improve your sound. For example - try this into a Fender Hotrod, you won't be disappointed.\nhttp://www.one-control.com/hookers-green-bassmachine.html",
