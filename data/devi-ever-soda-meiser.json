    "details": "Gated high gain fuzzBuilt with a streamlined interface of pregain and volume designed to produce, fat, round fuzz at lower gain and a fierce, fuzzing attack at higher gain, the Devi Ever Soda Meiser Fuzz offers a big spectrum of snarl in a compact, easy-to-use package. Compared to the tones of the Smashing Pumpkins and Jeff Buckley, the Soda Meiser works wonders complementing a synth or octave effect while also pushing more than enough vintage fuzz grit to stand on its own.\nhttps://deviever.net/collections/frontpage/products/devi-ever-fx-soda-meiser",
