    "details": "Plate Reverb Pedal with Key Sidechain EffectsCatalinbread takes an extremely thorough, thoughtful approach to every pedal they make. Case in point: the Catalinbread Talisman Plate Reverb Pedal. The Talisman reproduces the lush, natural-sounding magic of a 7' x 4' vintage plate reverb in a tour-friendly pedal format. To do so faithfully, Catalinbread included the studio-style side-chain effects that made the original units so useful and natural-sounding. The Talisman can be powered by any good-quality 9V–18V DC power supply (not included), and it features Highpass, Time, Pre Delay, Mix, and Volume controls, all supported by a tough metal chassis and a rugged footswitch that are ready for the road.\nhttps://catalinbread.com/products/talisman",
