    "details": "Tone Bender Fuzz + Rat Distortion The Katzenkönig combines the best elements of a Tone Bender MkII fuzz and a Rat distortion. \nThe circuit is all-discrete, using a trio of silicon transistors in a modified Tone Bender MkII arrangement with the output section of a Rat, including its clipping section, filter, and output buffer.\nThe result is a pedal tuned to offer a huge range of response - from a really beautiful singing tone, to tight, harmonically-rich crunch, all the way to fuzz mayhem. The Katzenkönig loves both single coils and humbuckers, and sounds great in front of a clean amp or an overdriven amp (or pedal).\nhttps://catalinbread.com/products/katzenkonig",
