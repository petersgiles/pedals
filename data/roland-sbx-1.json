It supports a vast array of both analog and digital devices through DIN SYNC, MIDI and USB, and any of these can be the master clock source. You can use the SBX-1 itself as the master sync and control your external devices with its rock-steady internal clock. With hands-on control over timing and groove, and support for CV/GATE, the SBX-1 is far from just an ordinary sync box.\nSimultaneous conversion between MIDI, DIN SYNC, and USB/MIDI\nControl external devices with SBX-1 as the master sync source\nShuffle adds swing to patterns generated on devices without swing, such as TR-808 and TB-303\nCV/GATE jacks introduce enormous creative possibilities\nSYNC button corrects timing errors with a single press\nOutput up to three channels of triggers or LFOs with different characteristics\nDIN SYNC supports both Sync24 and Sync48 compatible with a variety of rhythm machines\nWorks great with the TR-8 through optimized AUX jack\nRuns on USB bus power or with AC adapter",
