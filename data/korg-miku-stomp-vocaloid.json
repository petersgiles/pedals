Using the audio input, users can connect their instrument to the module and play a note, having Miku match the corresponding pitch, intonation, timbre, and vibrato. MIKU STOMP utilizes limited VOCALOID hardware technology, and is constructed upon the same principles as the VOCALOOP and eVOCALOID software.\nEffects and Peaks\nRandom, Scat, Laah, Lahh, Ahh, Pahh, Nyan, Phrase 1, Phrase 2, and Phrase 3\nhttp://www.korg.com/us/products/effects/mikustomp/",
