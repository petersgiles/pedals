    "details": "Fuzz/OctaveThe MXR Blue Box takes your guitar signal, fuzzes it up, then duplicates it 2 octaves down. You control the output and the mix between the dry signal and the effect. Using it 100% wet is quite an experience, but more recognizable sounds appear as you dial in more dry signal. The Blue Box is known for having a chaotic personality that can make each session a totally unique experience!\nhttps://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m103-7-10137-00654-6.do?sortby=ourPicksAscend&page=3&refType=&from=fn",
