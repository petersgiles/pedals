Purple funk.\nGet up for the DownStroke.\nThis Envelope/Low-Pass filter is funkier than nine pounds of shaving powder, and with the Fwonk control up high, it is anything but subtle or mellow.\nSerious low-end thump when desired, the FwonkBeta will probably knock down anything hanging on the wall, and maybe even push around free standing furniture.  It is just that off the chain.\nhttps://mrblackpedals.com/collections/pedals/products/fwonkbeta",
