    "details": "Bass CompressorThe JHS Lime Aid Bass Compressor answers the call for a bass-centric compression pedal with features like a three-knob interface of volume, comp, and blend, compact design, and easy to read LED indicator. Based off of the immensely popular Pulp n' Peel circuit, this modified rendition's punchy low-end response and ability to run the clean signal independently of the compressed one make it a fan favorite among the four-string crowd. Great for song sections that need a little more hutzpah in the bass, the Lime Aid is also one of those pedals you may just never turn off.",
