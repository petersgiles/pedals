Its six-position Range Selector control allows you to choose from six different frequency ranges, each position based on the unique tonal characteristics of our most prized wah specimens. The Variable Q control allows you to take the 535Q's response from narrow and sharp to broad and subtle with the twist of a control. Once you've got your sound, make sure it gets heard with the switchable boost-adjustable up to +18dB-that can create endless sustain on any note.\nThe 535Q provides control over the most important wah parameters so you can create your ultimate wah tone.\nhttps://www.jimdunlop.com/product/535q-7-10137-01456-5.do",
