Soon after the FD3 came out I started getting a steady flow of emails asking if I could “please make that into a single channel Boost pedal!” So I crammed the circuit into the smallest possible enclosure 4.5\" x 2.1\" x 2.3\" with battery tucked tightly inside and even engineered space-saving rear-mounted IN, OUT, and DC power jacks.\nhttps://www.fulltone.com/products/2b",
