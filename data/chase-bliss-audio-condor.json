    "details": "Analog Pre/EQ/FilterCondor™ is an analog multi-effect that allows sophisticated control over a wide range of effects including EQ, overdrive, boost, tremolo and filter tones. The pedal has a powerful parametric mids control that ranges from 150Hz to 5kHz along with a three separate low pass filter or bass boost/cut modes. Along with expansive frequency controls, Condor™ has gain and volume knobs and a switchable overdrive circuit for sculpting your ideal guitar tone. Like all Chase Bliss Audio™ pedals, all of these settings can be stored in presets, ramped, or controlled via expression pedal. Every knob and switch is connected to a little digital brain while your guitar signal stays 100% analog and never gets digitally processed.\nhttps://chaseblissaudio.com/shop-pedals/condor",
