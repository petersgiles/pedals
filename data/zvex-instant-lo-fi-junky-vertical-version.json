    "details": "Signal degradationZVEX has released a vertical version of the Instant Lo-Fi Junky stompbox. According to the brand, the circuit remains the same, but the stomper is now more pedalboard-friendly.\nThe Instant Lo-Fi Junky, which emulates the sonic character of the Lo-Fi Loop Junky, is a signal degradation unit that’s capable of deep chorus sounds, sparkling clear compression and warbly vibratos. At the heart of this pedal is a Comp/Lo-fi control which manages the compression-vibrato blend. This works with a wave shape control – triangle, wave or square – to achieve the pedal’s wide range of sounds.\nApart from these, the original’s volume, speed, tone and depth controls have been retained.\nhttps://www.zvex.com/guitar-pedals/instant-lo-fi-junky-vertical-guitar-effects-pedal",
