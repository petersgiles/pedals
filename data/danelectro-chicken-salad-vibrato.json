And yes, the name (along with most of the diner series Danelectro pedals) is horrible. But the sound, oh the sound. The Chicken Salad sounds as good or often better than many pedals that are two and three times its price.\nOne of the reasons the Chicken Salad sounds so darn good is that the circuit utilities are a variation on the lightbulb and photo resistor design of the classic UniVibe. As such, it sounds three-dimensional and offers up that classic slightly off-kilter watery swirl. In fact, the Chicken Salad sounds so good that there is a cottage industry that grew around rehousing its guts into a sturdier metal box. Because while the Chicken Salad sounds so great that you will want to use it all of the time, the crappy plastic housing and pots won't stand up to much in the way of heavy use.\nIt's been discontinued, but the price for the Chicken Salad when new was $40, give or take a few dollars. You can find them used for $30-70 depending on condition and how rare the seller believes them to be. If you can find one for at or around the original asking price, the Chicken Salad offers outstanding value and great vibes.\nhttps://tonereport.com/blogs/tone-tips/great-tone-great-price-top-5-danelectro-boxes",
