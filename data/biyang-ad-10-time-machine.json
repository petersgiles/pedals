    "details": "Analog DelayBiyang \"Babyboom\" is a totally brand new effect pedal series with a standard size cast aluminium enclosure. New on the AD-10 IS THE GROUPING OF TWO SEPARATE CHIP SETS. This has improved the delay fidelity and realistic trailing effects. Analog circuitry design is used for delay time realism for a pure sound that colors and creates great space in the sound.\nMax delay time is 1100ms (1.1seconds), and features a two mode toggle switch: 20-600ms, 20-1100ms. 600ms allows for a little faster repeats and delay times while the 1100ms is capable of longer slower delays. A nice feature depending on what you need a delay to do.\nhttp://www.biyang.nl/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&view=productdetails&virtuemart_product_id=1913&virtuemart_category_id=189",
