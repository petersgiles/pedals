Our best sounding Envelope Filter EVER.\nThe Keeley Neutrino V2 is an amazingly toneful and compact form of the classic opto-coupler envelope filter. The Neutrino takes your guitar playing and creates an automatic wah sound based on your pick attack! Envelope filters or auto-wahs as they are often called, sound and react best when they are opto-coupler based. The opto-couplers used in the Neutrino are particularly smooth, giving you an amazing vowel-like tone. The Keeley Neutrino gives you 3 filter ranges, 2 directions,  2 ranges for the frequency center and a Peak control. Keeley has engineered a power supply voltage-doubler so you maintain the highest headroom for your tone.  An incredibly tough build means it will last for many decades to come. Whether you’re in a jam band or playing funk, the Keeley Neutrino V2 delivers incredible vocal-like tone.\nThe Keeley Neutrino V2 features:\nEnvelope Filter and Auto-Wah for guitar, bass and keyboard\nPeak Control: Sets how much “quack” there is, or how smooth you roll\nFilter Selector: lets you choose between 3 types of filters: High,  Low, and Band Pass.\nRange Switch: HI or LO.\nDirection Switch: Up or Down\nTrue-Bypass, 9 VDC, 25 mA, 100% analog and made in the USA.\nhttps://robertkeeley.com/products/neutrinov2",
