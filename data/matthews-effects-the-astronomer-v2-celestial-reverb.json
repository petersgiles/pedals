A Hall Shimmer reverb that broke the mold of what customers had come to expect from a guitar pedal and for the last 3 years they have worked to improve and act on the feedback of the community to bring you a new age of Matthews Effects which promises to continue to push the limits of your expectations. \n\nCanis Major - The Dog is an EchoVerb designed with droning and swells in mind. Glow controls your shimmer mix and use \"Travel\" to set the dog loose to run away or drone infinitely.  Excels at pads and layering.\nOrion - The hunter is the classic hall reverb with shimmer. Tried and true the hunter excels as a hall reverb with \"Glow\" turned down all the way and dimed for a sound that feels straight from the heavens. Excels as your base reverb or ambient verb\nUrsa Major - The Bear is a chamber reverb with a pre octave mixed in with \"Glow\". Turn \"Glow\" all the way down for a haunting dark reverb great for lead lines and your base reverb or slowly turn up glow to taste to add a particle sound and emulate twinkling stars. Excels as your base reverb or ambient verb\n\nhttps://www.matthewseffects.com/products/the-astronomer-v2",
