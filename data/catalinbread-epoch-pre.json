    "details": "Preamp BufferThe only Preamp Buffer you'll ever need.\nOur Epoch Pre was modeled after the exact preamp circuit from the original EP-3, from the 22v power supply to the JFET preamp, to the circuit loading contributed by the echo function. Not only does it provide boost it acts like a mastering plug-in on the master fader - making your whole pedalboard sounds bigger, lusher, wider, the Epoch Pre can bundle all the frequencies without squishing them like a compressor!\nEpoch Pre Features:\n► Exact EP-3 preamp replica.\n► Accepts standard 9v pedal power supply but converts it to 22v internally.\n► Epoch Pre has two outputs to drive different pedal chains or two amps.\n► Discrete silicon transistor buffer, high headroom.\nhttps://www.catalinbread.com/index-epochpre.php?category=all",
