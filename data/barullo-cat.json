    "details": "Rat style distortion by BarulloHere’s the Cat distortion, and this cat could devour your rat. So if you like rodent pedals but need a better control over gain and a real eq, not just a filter pot, this is your pedal. It’s based on the classic LM308 chip followed by a James tonestack that lets you control both ends of the spectrum, making this a perfect pedal for bass players, baritones or downtuned guitars.\nCONTROLS\nGain: Controls the gain of the circuit, from an overdrive at its lowest setting to a high gain distorsion.\nHi: Controls the amount of high frequencies in the circuit.\nLo: Controls the amount of low end in the circuit.\nVolume: Controls the overall output level.\nhttps://barullofx.com/2018/09/29/cat-distortion/",
