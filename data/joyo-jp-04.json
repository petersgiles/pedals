    "details": "Isolated Power SupplyHave you ever found the strange noises jumping out of nowhere when using several pedals together? The biggest reason that produces such annoying sound is that pedals are connected in a parallel mode. With such parallel connection each pedal forms a ground loop, which brings the noises from other magnetic field into the signal path and all the other pedals are interfered and become unstable.
