    "details": "DC8 is a professional medium sized multi-output power supply for effect pedals. It has 8 regulated and well-filtered DC outlets configured in 6 isolated sections. With a total of 1.000mA it’s a perfect solution for small or medium size rigs with pedals only using a DC power source. Its two powerful sections with 300mA each will power pedals like the TC Electronic Nova-series, TC Helicon, Eventides, Strymons, BOSS twins, digital EHX pedals or other which draw a higher current than 100mA. The first 4 isolated outlets offering 4x100mA are ideal for 9 or 12V pedals needing less than 100mA. Combined with the included Stack Flex the DC8 will also power your 18V pedal.\nhttps://cioks.com/products/dc8/",
