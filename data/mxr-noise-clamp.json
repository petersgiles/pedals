By sensing your guitar's dry signal, The Noise Clamp reduces the noise level within the effect loop, coming down hard on even the noisiest signals. A single Trigger knob allows you to set the volume threshold at which the pedal is active, and a green LED shows whether the gate is on/off. This bad boy is capable of reducing Noise up to 26dB, maintaining riff definition at extreme gain levels.\nhttps://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m195-7-10137-05089-1.do",
