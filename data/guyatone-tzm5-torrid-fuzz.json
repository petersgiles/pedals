    "details": "Mighty Micro Fuzz Distortion PedalA new take on the classic three-transistor fuzz circuit, the TZm5 Torrid Fuzz was designed by notable Japanese engineer Toshi Torii of HAO fame.\nThe Torrid Fuzz offers a variety of wild and wooly tones that can emulate many classic fuzz pedals or create all-new fuzz effects.  Level and Depth controls vary the output and degree of distortion while Tone controls a hi-cut filter.  +/- Phase control allows for additional tuning of the fuzz effect, while the Attenuator control allows the TZm5 to be optimized for single coils or humbuckers.\nFrom classic Fuzz-in-your-Face spit to nu-rock shock, the TZm5 packs a plethora of fuzz effects into a pint-sized package!\nhttps://guyatoneus.com/shop/tzm5-torrid-fuzz/",
