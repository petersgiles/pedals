The Patchulator 8000 pedalboard patchbay provides a tangle-free way to change the order of your effects to create new tones using little to no brainpower! With the provided mini cables, just patch signal from your guitar or bass into (and out of) each effect, then back out to your amp or mixer. Invent new and interesting sounds while your synapses are firing, simply by rearranging the sequence of effects! All your gear and cabling stays put. Oh, and any effect not patched is \"truly\" bypassed... Genius!\nLobotomize Your Music Studio!\nAre your cables giving you a brain tumor? In the world of electronic music, the Patchulator 8000 desktop patchbay becomes a powerful nerve center for your instruments, allowing you to share and swap effects all around your setup, without needing to solve a brainteaser. Just connect your keyboards, synthesizers, samplers, drum machines (or any sound source) to a few channels, then fill the other channels with your effects' ins and outs. Using the mini patch cables, you can then route any of the effects into and out of the signal path of any instrument, just like a real patch bay! Hmmm... what will you mastermind?\nModulate Your Brainwaves!\nIn the world of modular synthesizers, the Patchulator 8000 is the brainstem between your modules and outboard gear, since it uses both standard and mini phono plugs. So if your brain tissue needs some electro-stimulation, simply inject control voltages and audio signals directly from your modular into effects units and chains. Better yet, use two Patchulator 8000s and seriously expand your cranial capacity! Whatever it is that you can brainstorm - guitar pedals and studio effects, synths and samplers, grooveboxes and drum machines, modulars and modulation signals, mixers and recording interfaces - the Patchulator 8000 allows it all to interconnect.\nhttp://www.boredbrainmusic.com/product/patchulator-8000/",
