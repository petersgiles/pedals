He asked me if I could make him a pedal that would loop short samples but whose sample size could be set by tapping a tempo. From there the pedal went through many iterations and a few months later we had something that seemed like a useful tool. It was a fun project and I really want to thank Kent for his input, ideas and the nice chats.\nFrom the original tap tempo micro looper idea, it has evolved (now in it’s V3 iteration) into a micro looper / time stretcher / glitch delay / audio freeze / reverb\nhttps://www.drolofx.com/product/stammen/",
