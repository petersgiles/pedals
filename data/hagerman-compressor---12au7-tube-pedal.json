    "details": "12AU7 Tube Compressor PedalThe COMPRESSOR is a boutique all-analog vacuum tube pedal designed to offer the most transparent compression available, combining great sustain and low noise operation. Its feed-forward side-chain and custom opto-resistive attenuation produces a soft knee, as opposed to hard limiting, providing a very natural presentation without pumping effects. This will be your always on pedal, and with tons of clean headroom, you can use it on vocals too.\nHand built in USA.\nhttps://www.hagamps.com/collections/pedals/products/compressor",
