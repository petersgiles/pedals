    "details": "Shimmer reverbSeraphim Shimmer combines the Wet Reverb with our celebrated shimmer effect, taking the \"choir of angels\" sound to a new level! Simple, versatile controls allow you to quickly dial in your ideal celestial sound.\nEven better—you can switch on-the-fly between shimmer and reverb-only with a long-press of the footswitch. It's like two pedals in one! Kick in the shimmer only when you need it—to add a little sparkle, or for a full keyboard pad effect.\nA long press of the footswitch is just like setting the Shim knob to 0, and a second long press sets it back to the knob position. This results in a seamless transition between shimmer and reverb-only with no break in the effect.\nSelectable buffered/trails or normal/true bypass\n    Mix knob adjustment from 0% to 100% wet\n    Analog dry signal for low noise and zero latency\n    Mono input & output\n    Compact footprint\n    Does not function with the ExP Controller\n    Requires standard 9V pedal power supply (not included)\n    Made in USA—designed and manufactured in Orange County, California\nhttps://neunaber.net/products/seraphim-shimmer",
