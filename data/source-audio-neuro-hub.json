    "details": "The Neuro Hub brings full MIDI functionality to all of Source Audio's One Series and Soundblox 2 pedals. Connect the Hub to as many as five pedals and combine them into a thoroughly integrated multi-pedal system. This breakthrough in effect technology introduces Source Audio’s new scene saving functionality, enabling the creation of up to 128 single or multi-pedal presets (i.e. “scenes”), each recallable via MIDI Program Change messages. Simply dial in your One Series and Soundblox 2 effects as you would any traditional pedalboard, then hit SAVE on the Hub and your pedal settings are captured! Enjoy the power of one-step scene recall without the headache of navigating a complicated multi-effects processor.\nhttps://www.sourceaudio.net/neuro-hub.html",
