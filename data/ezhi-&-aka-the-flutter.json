    "details": "The Flutter is a lo-fi flutter/vibrato/tapestop pedal controlled via non-linear strange IR sensor. It features a clean blend for very unusual chorus sounds and a low gritty fuzz mode. The IR sensor works nice both in light and in complete darkness. The sensor allows you to manipulate the pitch of your sounds creating different effects – from a slight flutter to heavy tapestops and crazy wobble.\nhttp://ezhiandaka.ru",
