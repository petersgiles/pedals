    "details": "The Boomster will cleanly boost your signal and grant you massive tone !\"As someone who likes a simple pedal that does one thing great instead of a dozen things poorly, I love the Boomster. One knob and one knob only! This pedal works great to beef up my signal with a very clean and full-sounding boost. Lately I’m finding it especially effective with my acoustic guitars, but it’s equally great when I’m rocking electric and want more gain without adding a layer of fuzz. Boomster makes my sound loud and clear ! \" Lee Ranaldo\nhttps://www.jampedals.com/mini-boomster/",
