Careful multiple clipping architecture design and development has meant we have achieved our goal of creating a pedal which captures the huge crunch of a Marshall on steroids.\nGAIN – from the lightest breakup to insane high gain scream\nTONE – custom taper control which adjusts the high end cut of the pedal.\nVOLUME – tapered for a more gradual and controlled volume sweep.\nINTERNAL PRESENCE CONTROL – for adjusting the ‘shape’ of the Crunch Box’s sonic footprint.\nhttps://miaudio.com/effects/crunch-box-distortion/",
