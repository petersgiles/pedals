    "details": "DRAUME is an exploration of artificial reverberation. Can a space sound dry, old, veiled or broken? Reverberation is typically associated with physical spaces or objects. A hall reverb should conjure the mental image of a hall, but what ambiance comes to mind when presented with intentionally artificial reverberation? DRAUME combines post-reverb processing with decay and system clock control to break the spatial illusion. Manual linked below.",
