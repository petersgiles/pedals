    "details": "Dual EQAs I found myself constantly tweaking my EQ, especially between mid boost/mid cut settings I thought it would be nice to have 2 presets available so I ended up making this dual EQ with 2 identical 3-band Baxandall filters and an 18V charge pump to give enough headroom and boost. It’s specially useful to sculpt the sound coming out of a fuzz or distortion.\nhttp://www.davidrolo.com/product/iketara-iku/",
