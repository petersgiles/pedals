    "details": "Four Output Guitar Amp Driver1×4 mono or 2×2 stereo operation\nIsolated outputs eliminate buzz and hum\nBuffered outputs prevent signal loss\n180° polarity switches to phase-match amps\nThe Shotgun makes it easy to drive multiple amplifiers cleanly and in phase without buzz or hum from ground loops. In mono operation, connect to input-1 of the Shotgun and you can feed up to four amps simultaneously. For stereo setups, the Shotgun automatically reconfigures when both inputs are used; feeding input-1 to the first two amplifiers, and input-2 to the second pair. Isolation transformers and ground lifts are included on the outputs to eliminate ground loop noise, along with 180° polarity reverse switches to ensure all amps are phase-matched.\nhttps://www.radialeng.com/product/shotgun",
