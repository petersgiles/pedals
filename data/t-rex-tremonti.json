But the last 30 years of rock music wouldn’t be the same without it, and each age of rock and roll has had its own master of shape-shifting sound.\nSIGNATURE SOUND\nTo create the new T-Rex phase-shifter, we teamed up with one of our time’s masters: Alter Bridge and former Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti. A devoted T-Rex user, Mark was looking for the perfect phaser to add to his onstage arsenal, and we’ve come up with a pedal he’s proud to endorse. Tremonti sets a new standard for gorgeous phased sound.\nPERFECT CONTROL\nTremonti Phaser delivers everything you expect in a phaser and then some. The Stage switch lets you choose between a raw, vintage-sounding effect and a richer, more modern swirl. And the ingenious Bite knob adds a sexy overdrive edge to any setting. Fast or slow, deep or shallow, vintage or modern, Tremonti Phaser delivers extraordinary-sounding phased modulation that will take your playing to another world.\nPHASE SHIFTER\n-Lets you choose between a raw, vintage-sounding effect and a richer more modern swirl\n-The Bite knob adds a sexy overdrive edge to any setting\n-Extraordinary modulation for both fast, slow, deep, shallow, vintage or modern music\nhttp://www.t-rex-effects.com/tremonti/",
