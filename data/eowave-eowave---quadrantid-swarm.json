    "details": "Digital Semimodular SynthesizerThe Quandrantid Swarm is a digital synthesizer that features a percussive element to give it a unique sound. It contains a two-pole analog filter, an LFO with eight waveforms, and a spring reverb. The eight touch keys can be used as a mono keyboard, polyphonic keyboard or an eight-step sequencer. The Quandrantid Swarm has MIDI and CV/Trig connectivity. Its normalized pre-patching allows you start creating immediately, but its semi-modular design allows you to use patch cables to explore the potential of this instrument.\nhttp://www.eowave.com/synthesizers/quadrantid-swarm/",
