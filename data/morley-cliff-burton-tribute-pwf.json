    "details": "Fuzz Wah The Morley PFW pedal blends two essential effects in one unit. These effects are wah and fuzz. You can either run both effects in tandem to achieve a tone that is aggressive or run them independently. The pedal also features a Vintage/Modern toggle. This toggle is useful if you are experimenting with new styles of music because it provides you with extra tonal options.\nhttp://www.morleypedals.com/cliff-burton-tribute-series-power-fuzz-wah/",
