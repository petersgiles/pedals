    "details": "ABY Signal SwitcherThe Morley ABY selector/combiner footswitch can be employed in a variety of situations; the choice between two inputs/one output, or one input/two outputs gives the user many options. You can, for instance, run a signal to a pair of amps for true stereo effect; switch between two amps for dirty/clean tones (perfect for that old tube amp with separate channels); bypass that noisy boutique stomp box or your entire pedal setup altogether; simultaneously run a keyboard and guitar through your effects chain, and more. Basically, you can route one signal to two outputs or two inputs to one output - then select between them or combine them.",
