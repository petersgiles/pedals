It is perfect for all effects, even germanium transistor overdrives.\nMode settings give you the ability to mix preset 'on the fly' for even greater flexibility.\nI believe that the signal that comes out of your guitar is precious. At TheGigRig we compromise on nothing to bring you some of the best gear on the planet, but don't take our word for it. Read the reviews and watch the demo.
