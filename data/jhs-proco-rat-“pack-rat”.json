    "details": "JHS modded Proco RatThe RAT is one of the most classic and original designs in the history of effects pedals. Guitar legends and bedroom rockers have found the sound that they want from this little black box. As classic as it is, there is always room for some exceptional improvements. We start by replacing the horrible factory chip with a little discovery of our own that no one else is using in their RAT modifications. You can expect all the vibe and mojo of the old LMN308 but with less noise and a more well rounded response. This gives a real dynamic change in the pedal as well as clarity in the lower gain settings. Other improvements in the signal path are made by replacing the cheap bargain capacitors with metal film and tantalum caps, as well as a few value changes along the way for optimum bass response and smooth silky highs.\nAfter all that’s done, we give you three clipping gain options (LEFT=vintage Si, MIDDLE=open boost, RIGHT=LED turbo RAT) with the flick of a mini toggle switch. You can get literally any sound you can think of out of this box when we're finished. It makes a great clean boost, light overdrive, crunchy rhythm channel, heavy Marshal-ish grind, over the top fuzz and the list goes on! This is the only pedal on earth that can give you sustain for days with such clarity and character.\nThis is one of our favorite mods of all time!\nhttps://www.jhspedals.info/proco-rat-rat-pack",
