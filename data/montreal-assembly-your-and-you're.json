The most recent run is green as pictured above and now has an expression pedal input. \nThe sound is generated by gating an internal oscillator with the input signal. TONE controls the frequency of the internal oscillator, if an expression pedal is plugged in, it works in series with the TONE knob. VOL controls the master output level.\nThis pedal is true bypass and runs off the usual negative tip 9V DC adapter, requiring less than 25mA. On the current batch the LED is white. \nhttp://mtlasm.blogspot.com/p/your-and-yourre.html",
