With a tap of your toe, the Mimiq Doubler instantly simulates all the intricacies and imperfections that create the massive tones of double-tracked guitars. Controls for Tightness, Dry, Effect, and Dubs dial the sound in for a tighter sound, a bit looser for a more organic feel, or even a sound with up to 4 tracks simultaneously.
