    "details": "Attack EqualizerAn innovative effect pedal from the venerable old Electro Harmonix Soundsmith. The knockout makes angular single coil sounds out of thick humbuckers - to explain it roughly. This is done with genuinely selected bass and treble frequencies that are mixed with the original signal. Edge without end - but also when the bass range is emphasised, there is no mulching. Instead, it produces a very contoured, crisp bass area. Uncomplicated, you can improve your sound or simply create a completely different sound variant from your favorite guitar.\nAttack Equalizer\nConverts humbucker sound into single coil sound\nConverts ST sound into T-Style sound\nDimensions (WxDxH): 102 x 121 x 64 mm\nhttps://www.thomann.de/gb/electro_harmonix_knock_out.htm",
