    "details": "FlangerBuilding on the 20-year legacy of the famous BOSS BF-2, the new BF-3 flanger pedal gives guitarists and bassists an updated version of the classic BOSS flanger with the thickest stereo flanging sounds ever. Two new modes (Ultra and Gate/Pan) create stereo flanging with incredible depth--even Slicer-type effects and sounds that seem to \"swirl\" around the listener. An instant classic.\nhttps://www.boss.info/us/products/bf-3/",
