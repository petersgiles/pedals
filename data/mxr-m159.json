The MXR M159 Tremolo Pedal keeps all the effects and controls of the original--but in a smaller, pedal board-friendly size. Its 18-volt operation provides rich and vibrant sound with low noise due to its high headroom. With the versatile input/output options the M159 guitar pedal can produce hypnotic, pulsing mono tremolo through a single amp or ping-ponged from one amp to another in stereo mode for a huge, spacious tone.\nPedalboard-friendly size\n18-volt operation\nVersatile input/output options",
