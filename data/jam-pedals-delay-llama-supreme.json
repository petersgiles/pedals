    "details": "Analog, Tap-Tempo Tape Delay pedalThis is an entirely analog delay pedal designed to emulate tape delay.  It has a tap tempo switch that can be held down to induce self-oscillation, a three--position subdivision switch, and built in effects circuits that only affect the repeats, including a filter and a chorus circuit identical to the Jam Pedals waterfall.  There are also two expression pedal inputs, one to modulate the delay time and one to modulate the delay level.\nhttp://www.jampedals.com/delay-llama-supreme/",
