    "details": "Germanium FuzzThe Havalina Germanium Fuzz from Way Huge Electronics is a germanium-powered fuzz box inspired by a vintage 3-transistor design that became the psychedelic shot-heard-round-the-world for guitar players, ushering in the new sound of rock. Designed around hand-selected Russian germanium transistors and a passive tone circuit, this peccary of a pedal can go from a soft, mellow crunch for meaty chords to a maelstrom of sonic fur that will make every note feel like a summer of love. Prepare to have your mind bent when you ride the Havalina Germanium Fuzz! \nhttps://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Havalina--way-huge-havalina-germanium-fuzz-pedal",
