    "details": "Way Huge WM28 Smalls Overrated Special Overdrive - Joe BonamassaDesigned in conjunction with bluesman Joe Bonamassa, the Way Huge Smalls Overrated Special Overdrive delivers a range of bold, punchy grit. Jeorge Tripps took an old school Green Rhino OD, hot-rodded it for a more pronounced midrange, and added a Freq control so that you can punch up the low mids. Volume, Tone, and Drive controls round out a straightforward user interface so you can plug in and get right to\nit. Run the Overrated Special OD in front of a clean amp for a gritty boost, or slam an already distorted channel for an electrifying surge of gain and sustain worthy of Joe Bonamassa’s searing leads. Now in a Way Huge Smalls housing, this little box of dirt will find an easy home on your pedalboard.\nhttps://www.jimdunlop.com/way-huge-smalls-overrated-special-overdrive/",
