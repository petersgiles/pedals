    "details": "VL4A surprising number of songs trick other harmonizers because these songs just don’t work with a single key/scale setting. In fact, any song that has the same note sung over two different chords (for example, a C sung in the melody over a C maj / F maj chord sequence) is going to confound conventional harmonizers.\nThe Live 4 uses breakthrough musIQ® technology to directly analyze the output of any electric or pre-amplified acoustic guitar (no special MIDI guitars or hex-outputs needed). Then it generates the correct vocal harmony. For example, if you’re singing an A over the chords that are generally found in the key of G, Vocalist will harmonize with a C. But, if you then play an A major, Vocalist will shift to the C#...because like any good harmony singer, it listens to the guitar! With musIQ, forget about the technology – just sing and play! Skip complicated programming and having to analyze each song chord-by-chord; just…\n\nPlug in your microphone and guitar;2. Pick a 3rd or 5th-above or below  harmony preset;3. Sing and play — when you want harmony, just step on the footswitch!\n\nMUSIQ® MAKES THE LIVE 4 SO EASY TO USE\nmusIQ is a revolutionary technology that eliminates the need program a song’s key or changes to create accurate harmonies. musIQ analyzes your lead vocals as well as the chords and notes played on a guitar in real-time to automatically generate perfect vocal harmonies.
