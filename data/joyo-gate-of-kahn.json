In the unlikely event that you're still getting more noise than you want then ever so slightly increase the threshold control but remember a little adjustment goes a long way!!!\nInput Impedance: 1M Ω\n    Output Impedance: 100 Ω\n    Running Current: 20mA\n    Power: DC 9V centre - \n    Dimension(mm):73x43x50\n    Weight: 220g\nhttps://www.joyoaudio.co.uk/joyo-jf-324-gate-of-kahn-noise-gate-ironman-mini-guitar-effects-pedal",
