If you’re using one guitar through a complex pedalboard, your signal strength can also suffer due to cable capacitance. Enter the Level Set Buffer, a brilliant buffer pedal that lets you easily swap guitars without negatively affecting your tone. This original design features Level, Hi-Freq and Load controls to adjust the signal, along with a Main Mute footswitch for silent tuning. The tuner output lets your tuner be always on without interrupting your signal path.\nLevel and Hi-Freq trim controls\n    Main Mute footswitch for silent tuning\n    LED backlit knobs\n    Fender Amp Jewel LED\n    Magnetically latched hinged 9V battery door\n    Lightweight durable anodized aluminum construction\nhttps://shop.fender.com/en-NL/accessoriespedals-power-products/level-set-buffer-pedal/0234530000.html?rl=en_US",
