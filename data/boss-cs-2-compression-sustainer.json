    "details": "The CS-2 compresses high-input signals while boosting low-input signals, giving you smooth and long sustain without degrading the quality of the original sound. The CS-2 uses a VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier) instead of the photocouplers used by the CS-1. The VCA’s speeds up the signal processing and makes the attack much faster compared to the CS-1. The Attack knob can however be used to control this.\nSpecifications\nControls: Level, Attack, Sustain\nConnectors: Input, Output, AC Adaptor\nCurrent Draw: 4 mA (DC 9V)\nWeight: 400g (15 oz.)\nInput Impedance: 1MOhm\nRecommended AC Adaptor: ACA Series\nLabels\nBlack – Made In Japan\nThe CS-2 was sold from December 1981 to June 1986.\nhttp://www.bossarea.com/boss-cs-2-compression-sustainer/",
