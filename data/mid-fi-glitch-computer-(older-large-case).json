    "details": "High gain fuzz with poorly tracking 2 octave down harmony, from slight glitches to full on random arpeggiation. Yeeeee-haw!!!\nYou want the sound of a thousand crickets escaping from a mental institution? Then the pedal is for you.  Hard to control, weird sub-octave tracking. Can sound like a Gameboy/Torture-Device. Other points of note: 1) It sustains really well. 2) It does things that are hard to do twice 3) Great for endless laughter\nHeight measurement includes knobs. 108mm\nJust the case is 90mm.\nhttps://www.midfielectronics.com/glitchcomputer",
