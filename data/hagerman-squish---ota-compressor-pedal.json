    "details": "Compressor PedalSQUISH is a gentle compressor with low distortion that doesn't affect tone. Using a feed-forward architecture, it responds to dynamic volume changes in a subtle fashion, unlike the industry-standard (Ross) feedback type. The OTA circuit provides fast response without compromising signal quality, maintaining dynamics, and providing a much more natural presentation. Optimally dialed in for humbuckers. Great on bass!\nSpecifications\nTrue bypass\n16dB gain\n180k ohm input impedance\n0.2% distortion\n20 to 8kHz bandwidth\n3V output capability\n9V to 12V @ 12mA power\nhttps://www.hagamps.com/collections/silicon/products/squish-ota-compressor-pedal",
