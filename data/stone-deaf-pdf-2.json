As the younger brother and the successor to the original pedal, the PDF-2 improves on the design with a reduced noise floor, adjustable gain knob and a dual foot-switch for clean and dirty channels. \n​\nPDF-2 is one hell of a versatile pedal that’s applicable to many instruments. From Electric Piano, Bass, Drums and Synths, to Electric and Acoustic Guitars, this little beast of a circuit has proven itself as one of the most useful pedal based EQ, Boost and Distortion devices on the market. \n​\nAdd a Stone Deaf EP-1 active expression pedal to the expression input control and on top of the impressive regular tone shaping features, PDF-2 can also be used for wah, phaser and manual tonal shifts to give you even more tonal creativity. \n*** Please note *** \nThe expression input will only work with Stone Deaf EP-1 active expression pedal. \nUsed by many professionals on tour, PDF-2 has proved to be a rugged design due to the pedal’s high quality construction. \nEach PDF-2 is proudly manufactured by Stone Deaf in our factory based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England.\nhttp://www.stonedeaffx.com/pdf-2",
