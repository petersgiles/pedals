    "details": "Fuzz/OverdriveClassic dual overdrive. The original 1969 plug-in Muff Fuzz had just a touch of overdrive and sounded like a vintage amp with a slightly torn speaker. We paired two of these together in one box to create the Double Muff. Use just one Muff for a hint of milky distortion, or cascade the second Muff for over-the-top overdrive that turns the milk into cream. Two distortions in one! Now in a compact, rugged Nano-sized package.\n\nTrue bypass\n9 volt battery included\nOptional 9.6DC-200 power supply available\nDimensions in inches: 2.75 (w) x 4.5 (l) x 2.1 (h)\nDimensions in mm: 70 (w) x 115 (l) x 54 (h)\n\nhttp://www.ehx.com/products/double-muff",
