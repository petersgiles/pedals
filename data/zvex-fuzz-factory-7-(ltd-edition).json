When Zack found a supply ofblack glass germanium transistors from the mid-fifties, he was so inspired by their unique look and sonic character, that he designed a new Fuzz Factory specifically to showcase them. Where the Fat Fuzz Factory has a 3 position toggle, The FF7 has a nine position rotary switch and covers enormous sonic territory, from earthshaking low frequencies to “dog whistle” (figuratively) high frequencies. The Fuzz Factory 7 also has a passive tone control (with its own switch) to roll off high end if need be.",
