While we were at it, we had our good friend Kurt Ballou (GCI / Converge) add a Mids control and we updated the Fuzz 1/2 switch to a soft-touch relay based switch.\nThe Demon Lung is based on the Boss FZ-2 Hyper Fuzz pedal. The two fuzz modes are switchable via footswitch for multiple tone settings on the fly. Includes a clickless bypass switch & top mounted jacks making it an easy addition to your pedalboard! \nhttps://www.abominablepedals.com/collections/pedals/products/demon-lung-hyper-fuzz",
