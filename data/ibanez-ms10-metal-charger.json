It has five controls to let you really capture the rage in your guitar. There is a Drive control that varies the amount of distortion, an Attack control for predistortion, treble and boost and Punch and Edge controls that provide post distortion equalization. Plug into an MS10 and you will swear that you have a wall of power behind you.\nhttp://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/ibanez/10/ms10",
