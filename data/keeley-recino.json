    "details": "Latin for echo, the RECINO Digital Delay is a super clean digital delay with up to one full second in delay time. It's an FV-1 Spin Semi-conductor-based design, so you know it has fantastic audio quality and response. Keeley has taken the design and given it ultra low noise, real-world usable tones and effects that are uber-dependable. This means you get no unwanted distortion from the DSP processor and that the audio is treated in a way that doesn't sound glassy or sterile. As with all Keeley Engineered products, this stomp box is easy to set and forget.",
